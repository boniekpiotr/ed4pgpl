There are three main concepts in&nbsp;troll honor: katorr, kat&rsquo;ral, and katera, loosely translated as personal, clan, and racial&nbsp;honor. Individual trolls define&nbsp; these values in different ways and to varying degrees, and a troll that lives among other Namegivers is less likely to react violently to an&nbsp;insult than a Crystal Raider, but a troll will defend his honor if he believes it has been&nbsp;slighted. Highland trolls guilty of crimes against honor will sometimes have their&nbsp;horns cut off, marking them as kava, or &ldquo;mud people&rdquo;, and exiled from troll society.&nbsp;Some trolls voluntarily undergo this punishment as a way of maintaining personal&nbsp;honor, and take pride in their status as outcasts.</p>","racialAbilites":"<p><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-family: 'ArnoPro Regular'; font-size: large;\">Heat Sight:&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"color: #191813; font-family: 'ArnoPro Regular'; font-size: large;\">Characters with Heat Sight can see heat radiated by another character or object, which translates into different colors.

Skin color ranges from yellow-green to&nbsp;emerald and aquamarine, with deep blue and sunset red variants also possible. T&rsquo;skrang&nbsp;are hairless, but most individuals sport a head crest of some sort. Their ears are&nbsp;small and cauliflower-shaped.</p>\n<p>T&rsquo;skrang are semi-aquatic, living on and around the lakes and rivers of Barsaive.&nbsp;They love to swim and tend to get irritable when they can&rsquo;t regularly submerge themselves&nbsp;in water.</p>\n<p>Their villages and towns are frequently housed in underwater domes, with towers&nbsp;that reach to the water&rsquo;s surface, with facilities to dock riverboats&nbsp;and ferries. These communities are made up of tightly-knit, communal&nbsp;groups called nialls, with the entire niall an extended&nbsp;family that follows a matriarch called a lahala. Sometimes&nbsp;several nialls will band together to form an aropagoi, or&nbsp;great house, which will follow a shivalahala.&nbsp;T&rsquo;skrang lay eggs, which take eight to ten months&nbsp;to hatch. The eggs of a niall are incubated together&nbsp;in a special room in the village, and after hatching&nbsp;the young are raised together. As a result, t&rsquo;skrang&nbsp;do not generally know who their egg-mother is, and&nbsp;view their egg-mates as siblings.</p>\n<p>Young t&rsquo;skrang come into the world with their&nbsp;gender unknown. When they undergo puberty after&nbsp;their first decade, their sex is revealed. T&rsquo;skrang live&nbsp;an average of 80 years, though tales of individuals&nbsp;living well over a century are not unheard of.&nbsp;The t&rsquo;skrang are known as merchants&nbsp;and traders, sailing their riverboats up&nbsp;and down the length of the Serpent River&nbsp;and its tributaries. The riverboats are&nbsp;driven by magical engines powered by&nbsp;elemental air and fire, and their operation&nbsp;is a closely guarded secret.&nbsp;Attempts by dwarf scholars and engineers&nbsp;to unlock the mysteries of this&nbsp;magic have&mdash;thus far&mdash;met with failure.</p>\n<p>T&rsquo;skrang have a flair for the dramatic, and their culture reveres the ideals of fearlessness,&nbsp;passion, and bravery. Other races frequently interpret this as mere bravado.&nbsp;Because of the communal nature of their villages, t&rsquo;skrang do very well in groups, and&nbsp;are a sociable people. They frequently consider other Namegivers as dull and boring,&nbsp;while the other races consider them flamboyant and foolish.</p>","racialAbilites":"<p>Tail Combat: T&rsquo;skrang often make use of their tails when engaged in combat. A t&rsquo;skrang can use his tail to whip at opponents in unarmed combat much like striking with an arm or kicking with a leg, using an appropriate unarmed combat talent or skill for any Attack tests. The Damage Step used is the character&rsquo;s Strength Step, unless modified by abilities that enhance unarmed combat Damage. A t&rsquo;skrang may also attach a melee weapon of up to Size 2 to his tail, and this is treated as an @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.EFrrXB3rYf9M16cN]{Attached Weapon}.

A windling&rsquo;s skin and hair color match&nbsp;the brightest-colored features of their home environment: the icy white of a snowy&nbsp;mountain, the red and yellow of wildflowers, even the glazed blue of city roof tiles.&nbsp;After a windling has lived in the same place for three or four months, their skin color&nbsp;will change to match their new home.</p>\n<p>They have almost no body hair, but the hair on their heads is thick and rich for&nbsp;their size. Their ears come to an even sharper point than elven ears.&nbsp;Windlings mature slowly, reaching adulthood by around age thirty, though their&nbsp;general attitude can frequently come across as childlike, even in older individuals.&nbsp;The average windling lifespan is roughly 170 years, and they do not appear to physically&nbsp;age during their lifetime.</p>\n<p>While their small size and&nbsp;somewhat fragile nature makes&nbsp;them more aware of the world&rsquo;s&nbsp;dangers, windlings love traveling&nbsp;and experiencing new things. Indeed,&nbsp;they have a passion and zest&nbsp;for life that few can equal, though&nbsp;their curiosity and fascination with&nbsp;new experiences can come across&nbsp;as flighty and unfocused.</p>\n<p>Windlings typically live&nbsp;in forested areas, in dwellings&nbsp;made from the local&nbsp;environment. Their society is&nbsp;best described as haphazard&mdash;&nbsp;members of a clan frequently bring&nbsp;back practices and fads they pick up in&nbsp;their travels, so there can be little consistency&nbsp;from village to village. There are&nbsp;tales of windling nobles, but scholars believe&nbsp;this to be no more than a rumor.</p>\n<p>Windlings frequently have a live and let live attitude,&nbsp;but their ability to fly gives them a strong love&nbsp;of freedom and as a general rule they abhor slavery.&nbsp;They are a gregarious and outgoing people, and their love&nbsp;of life is frequently expressed through finding the bright side&nbsp;of things. They have a reputation among the other races as incorrigible&nbsp;pranksters, and their almost permanent perky and&nbsp;optimistic attitude can come across as grating.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more than any other Namegiver race, windlings are in tune with the&nbsp;magic of the world. Almost all windlings can sense the magical world, and windling&nbsp;adepts have been known to develop this ability to high degrees.</p>","racialAbilites":"<p>Astral Sight: All windlings have access to the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.talent-description.Astral Sight]{Spojrzenie astralne} Talent.

Flying&nbsp;tires them quickly and windlings usually limit their flights to short periods of around&nbsp;fifteen to twenty minutes. When flying for extended periods of time, a windling may&nbsp;suffer Strain. After 20 minutes in flight a windling must make a Toughness (5) test.&nbsp;Failure means the character takes 1 Strain. Each five-minute period spent flying beyond&nbsp;the additional twenty minutes requires an additional Toughness test with a cumulative&nbsp;+2 modifier.</p>\n<p>Brief interruptions do not reset the time spent flying, it reduces it on a one-to-one basis: a windling who has spent twenty minutes in flight and then rests five minutes can only fly for five more minutes before having to make Toughness Tests again. Though windling wings are durable, they become heavy and fragile when wet, severely impairing the windling&rsquo;s ability to fly. When soaked with water, like falling into a stream or in heavy rain, their flight duration is reduced from twenty minutes to five, and the Difficulty Number of the Toughness tests increases by +2 every minute, instead of every five.

Dwarfs reach physical maturity&nbsp;in their late teens, and tend to live for about 100&nbsp;years.</p>\n<p>Dwarfs have an affinity for the earth, feeling a&nbsp;kinship with stone and metal. This, coupled with&nbsp;a strong inclination for organization and attention&nbsp;to detail, makes them a race of builders and&nbsp;craftsmen.

Dwarfs prefer to live close to, or even under,&nbsp;the earth, with multiple generations of extended family under the same roof.</p>\n<p>While loyal and efficient, dwarfs can be quick to latch onto a single solution and&nbsp;stubbornly resist change.
