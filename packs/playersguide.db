Some are terms common to most roleplaying games, others are unique to Earthdawn. Whether you are an experienced gamer or new to roleplaying, once you understand how these concepts operate in Earthdawn, the rest of the rules will fall easily into place. </p>\n<h3>Steps And Action Dice</h3>\n<p>Almost all abilities in Earthdawn are rated by Rank and Step numbers. Rank is the measure of proficiency in a talent or skill. Ranks are usually added to an Attribute to determine a Step number. The Step determines what dice a player rolls to perform actions in the game. Steps are ordered on an increasing scale, and each level of this scale corresponds to different dice. The Step/Dice Table lists Step numbers and their corresponding dice.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Darra has a Dexterity Step of 7 and Rank 3 with Melee Weapons. This gives her a Step 10 (7 + 3 = 10). Looking up this Step on the Step/Dice Table, Darra’s player notes that she rolls 2D8 when using her Melee Weapons. </em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Earthdawn uses six different types of polyhedral dice: four-sided (D4), six-sided (D6), eight-sided (D8), ten-sided (D10), twelve-sided (D12), and twenty-sided (D20) dice. These dice don’t come with the game, but are available in most gaming stores. </p>\n<p>Whenever a character attempts an action like casting a spell, swinging a sword at an enemy, tracking a Horror, or flirting with a barmaid, you roll the dice to determine the action’s outcome. These dice rolls are called tests. To make a test, you roll the appropriate dice based on the Step and add the individual die results together to determine the test result.</p>\n<p>In most published Earthdawn products, attributes, talents, skills, and the like are presented Step Number/Dice (for example Step 8/2D6). </p>"},"_id":"6v2Pl4wchpuoJHYO","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747835428,"modifiedTime":1671747853392,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"0B0bfqvFrMjIKPvi","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Kingdom Of Throal","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>In many ways, the Kingdom of Throal is the economic and political heart of Barsaive. Located beneath the Throal Mountains in central Barsaive, The dwarf kingdom’s influence extends back to before the Scourge, when the dwarfs acted as provincial administrators for the Theran Empire. As the Scourge approached, and the Therans retreated to their island homeland, it fell to the dwarfs of Throal to do what they could to prepare Barsaive for the Scourge. The distribution of the Book of Tomorrow made the dwarf language the de facto common tongue of Barsaive. Dwarven philosophers and scholars developed the ideas that led to the rejection of slavery, and set the province on the path of throwing off the Theran yoke. Many adventurers are sponsored by the Kingdom, and the reach and influence of the Throalic merchant houses is unparalleled.</p>\n<p>The Kingdom is made of several distinct areas. Just inside the massive gates is the Grand Bazaar, the largest market in Barsaive. Goods and services from the everyday to the exotic can be found here, from smiths and soothsayers to tailors and troubadours. Mundane or magical, the odds are good if you can’t find what you’re looking for in the Grand Bazaar you aren’t looking hard enough.</p>\n<p>Beyond the Bazaar are the Halls of Throal, the tunnels that made up the original kaer for the dwarf kingdom. Twisting and turning into the depths of the mountains, the poorer sections are closest to the Grand Bazaar while the wealthier estates are found deeper in.</p>\n<p>At the far end of the Halls is the Inner Kingdom, where the Great Library, the Grand Auditorium, and Royal Chambers are located.</p>\n<p>After the Scourge, King Varulus III commissioned the construction of the Inner Cities, built into deep mountain caverns. While the Halls of Throal are largely inhabited by dwarfs, the inner cities are home to the majority of the other Namegiver races in Throal. Nine cities were planned, and seven of them completed construction before the death of Varulus III and the Second Theran War. The two incomplete cities (Raithabal and Thurdane) have started to become a concern, as they have become a hangout and hideaway for gangs, smugglers, and those looking to evade or escape notice.</p>\n<p>Throal’s current ruler is Kovar I. At the tail end of the Second Theran War King Neden, the prior ruler, was killed without an heir. The tensions between the different noble houses grew considerably more strained, and it was only through the dedicated efforts to keep the peace that civil war was averted. Kovar was the compromise candidate, hailing from a minor—but still noble—house, his rule so far has been unremarkable. Some observers feel that he is clearly struggling to get comfortable on the throne, and that his inexperience is helping the more conservative “old guard” houses to gain more influence in Throal’s policies and practices.</p>\n<p>The end result is that in many ways, Throal has withdrawn from wider involvement in Barsaive’s affairs. While merchant caravans and trade envoys still travel the land, the war cost the lives of many Throalic soldiers, and patrols are less frequent and closer to home. At a time when the people of Barsaive could most use a guiding vision and clear direction, the dwarfs of Throal are not providing it.</p>"},"_id":"3szX4hXfA7v7iDje","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747834637,"modifiedTime":1671747854185,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"0Y7s9JwkSXyqSsF0","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

In Earthdawn, these mundane abilities are called skills. Skills add a bonus to one of your character’s Attribute Steps, giving him an advantage when taking actions, engaging in combat, and so on. Skills allow a character to perform certain actions and to make informed decisions about various courses of action during an adventure.</p>\n<p>There are four types of skills: Artisan, General, Knowledge, and Language. Artisan skills represent the arts and crafts practiced by every Namegiver; General skills allow your character to perform everyday actions; Knowledge skills represent how much your character knows about the world of Earthdawn; Language skills determine the spoken or written languages your character is fluent in.</p>\n<p>Skills are similar to talents, except they do not require magic to learn and use. Instead, a character must invest time, effort, and money to acquire them. In this age of magic, skills are largely the domain of ordinary folk, though all adepts begin the game with a few skills and, over time, most adepts like to learn more skills to supplement their magical talents.</p>\n<h3>Skills Versus Talents</h3>\n<p>Many skills have a magical talent equivalent. This chapter includes a list of such skills, but in most cases the difference between the magical and non-magical versions are small enough that the differences are described as part of the talent description. Some adepts know both skilled and talented versions of the same ability; in such cases, the player must decide which type he is using before making any tests—most times an adept will use a talent over a skill, but there are powers and spells that can suppress magic, including talents. For this reason, many adepts like to have a mundane “backup” skill, just in case.</p>\n<h3>Learning &amp; Improving Skills</h3>\n<p>Because it takes good old-fashioned physical and mental effort, skills take more effort to learn than talents. A character must take the time to train and practice to learn a new skill or to improve a skill he already knows. Sometimes they need to spend money to pay an instructor.</p>\n<p>Skill ranks that the player assigns during character creation assume that the character picked up the skill during his adolescence. To add ranks later in life, the character must find and learn from a suitable tutor. If your character has the Legend Points needed to gain an additional rank in a skill and access to a tutor or other source of training, he can improve that skill. See @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.cQzedYByq8oQcns3]{Improving Skill Ranks}, for more information.</p>\n<h3> </h3>"},"_id":"rMhxO0o8XzwbSlIx","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747833643,"modifiedTime":1671747853568,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"1tAED8kwJtowZD11","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

The Difficulty Number is usually given in the ability’s description or determined by the gamemaster. In many cases when the player characters must make a test, the required ability is shown with the Difficulty Number of the task in parentheses.

In addition to gear such as weapons, armor, and clothing, characters will need to obtain food, lodging, and transport during their travels. This chapter provides descriptions of a range of commonly available goods and services, their prices, any restrictions on their use, and directions for purchasing them.</p>\n<h3>Item Characteristics</h3>\n<p>Each and every item in Earthdawn is handcrafted and unique. Availability, Weight, Size, and Cost vary greatly from item to item and from region to region. Bartering and haggling is the norm in Barsaive, as is the customization of every item available. The following rules cater for this variation and offer gamemasters and players an easy way to deal with this topic and haggle over the price.</p>\n<h4>Availability</h4>\n<p>An item’s Availability Rating determines how hard the item is to find. <img style=\"float:right;margin-left:8px;margin-bottom:8px\" src=\"modules/ed4pgpl/assets/pictures/obsidiman-in-robes.jpg\" width=\"245\" height=\"315\" />The different Availability Ratings for goods and services are:</p>\n<p><strong>Everyday</strong> goods can be found virtually everywhere in Barsaive—just head to the nearest village! They are what even simple farmers in Barsaive’s hinterlands use to do their fieldwork every day, enjoy in their pastime, or consume to live on a day-to-day basis.</p>\n<p><strong>Average</strong> rated goods are still readily available, but might only be found in town markets on a regular basis. They are not bought by everyone on a daily basis, but it usually is not hard to find them if you need them, although purchase in rural areas might have to be planned ahead.</p>\n<p><strong>Unusual</strong> items are often found only in the markets of Barsaive’s larger towns and cities or specialist craftsmen’s workshops. Regular folks do not need them, or only buy them once in a lifetime. A few common magic items fall into this category. </p>\n<p><strong>Rare </strong>items are harder to find, even in places like the Grand Bazaar. Consumers are usually rich or in need of very special items—and adventurers are often in need of very special items. Most common magic items fall into this category.</p>\n<p><strong>Very Rare</strong> goods often require research to find a willing supplier. They are either very exotic and from far away lands or have powerful magic abilities. An item’s Availability Rating is shown along with its other characteristics in the tables found throughout this chapter. Availability Ratings usually assume a typical example of merchandise, bought in Barsaive; that is, an item not limited to a certain home region or possessing any special properties. Under certain circumstances or for specific items, the Availability Rating may be adjusted for better or worse. For example, the Theran Uyglar is a Rare food, but when in the Theran-occupied areas south of Vivane it might be of Average availability. And while a broadsword is of Average Availability, one explicitly of t’skrang design might be Rare in Jerris, and one bearing Jerrisian ornamentation is Rare in the t’skrang villages along the Serpent River.</p>\n<h4>Cost</h4>\n<p>An item’s Cost is usually expressed in silver pieces, the most common form of currency in the Province of Barsaive (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.vzIudrfuduswVm69]{Currency}). Some very cheap items have their Cost listed in copper pieces (“cp”). The cost listed with each item is what a standard item of its type costs in a place appropriate to its Availability Rating. The gamemaster should adjust the price if a character wants to buy an item in a place it is not normally available. For example, a pole-axe is an Unusual weapon with a Cost of 150 silver pieces, and is available at this price in most larger cities. If a character wanted to buy it in a village and the gamemaster decided it was indeed available there, because the headman had a single such weapon to defend against dangerous beasts, the cost could be double or even triple the normal price, because the headman could not re-acquire such a weapon easily.</p>\n<p>Cost and Availability usually go hand-in-hand; everyday items are cheap, rare items are expensive.</p>\n<p><strong>Races and Cost</strong></p>\n<p>Some races modify the cost of an item due to their unique physique. Usually, this means that such an item needs to be specially fitted for that race, except where made in an area where that race is predominant, or if commissioned ahead of time to a craftsman familiar with that race’s needs.</p>\n<p>Trolls and Obsidimen require more material to cover their bodies in armor, and so pay 25 percent more for armor (multiply the Cost by 1.25). Windlings require less material to cover their bodies in clothing or armor and so pay 25 percent less (multiply the Cost by 0.75).</p>\n<p>Windlings also sometimes want weapons normally intended for larger races balanced for their special needs. This does not impact a weapon’s characteristics, it simply makes it more comfortable to use and “looks right” on a windling. This increases the cost of the item by 25 percent.</p>\n<p>For magic items, most of the item’s cost is often a result of the enchantment. Do not modify the cost of a magic item made for other races. Windlings usually pay half for a meal in an inn.</p>\n<p>T’skrang pay a fitting fee when buying armor or clothing to accommodate their tail, increasing the cost by 10 percent (multiply the Cost by 1.1). If the armor or clothing covers the tail instead of just providing a hole for it, increase the cost by 25 percent (multiply the Cost by 1.25).</p>\n<h4>Size </h4>\n<p>Item Size is most commonly found in weaponry. The physical make-up of different races allows them to wield weapons of different dimensions. For example, windlings require smaller weaponry, while trolls and obsidiman can use larger weapons.

Weights given are for typical items of their type, which usually assumes they are made for a human-sized Namegiver. Some items are expressly made for or by other races and are larger or smaller, and therefore more or less heavy.</p>\n<p><strong>Races and Weight</strong></p>\n<p>Items assuming a human physique sometimes need to be modified to generate the appropriate item for trolls, windlings, obsidiman, and sometimes t’skrang. While these races can use many items assuming a human physique, they typically require more material for clothing and armor. If made by a member of that race for that race, the item would be more appropriately sized. For example, a troll can sit on a bench made by a human craftsman, but if a troll craftsman would make it to use in his home, the bench would simply be bigger. Some items, such as troll swords or windling bows—items that call out a race by name—are already suited for that race and need not be modified. Items for trolls are usually also suitable to be used by obsidimen.</p>"},"_id":"l6JuhSuyucxeK956","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747834994,"modifiedTime":1671747853962,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"5L0i50GNPxIU09iG","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Questors","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>The term questor refers to someone who has devoted himself or herself to a spiritual quest, in this case devotion to a particular Passion. They dedicate their lives to fostering its ideals in the lives of all people. The characteristics of questors vary from Passion to Passion. Some general traits exist among most or all questors. With the exception of those who follow the Mad Passions, questors with different patron Passions do not bear each other ill will. Each Passion embodies different ideals and emotions, and their questors understand that they are all equally significant parts of a whole that comprises the life of Namegivers.</p>\n<p>Though the Passions do not directly support political factions or causes, questors can and often do. For example, many dwarf questors in Throal call Thystonius their patron Passion. Their questor order has a military nature, and they use gifts from Thystonius to give the Kingdom of Throal military protection. If other questors of Thystonius chose to attack Throal, such an act would bring questors of the same Passion into direct conflict with each other. Such a development would gladden Thystonius. Though he would mourn those killed in the conflict, the bravery of his questors on both sides would bring him great joy.</p>\n<p>Patron Passions bestow abilities on their questors. Questors cultivate these abilities by focusing their lives around a certain behavior—in this case, spreading their Passion’s ideals across Barsaive. Some abilities are common to the questors of several Passions. Others are unique to a single Passion.</p>\n<p>The abilities given are usually tied in some way to the ideals, goals, and powers of a particular Passion. For example, questors of Garlen frequently have the ability to magically seal a home from outside attack, while a questor of Floranuus might have the ability to increase the speed of a ship.</p>\n<p>The life of a questor does not typically earn him a living. Questors sometimes form small, loosely organized groups to discuss the creed of their chosen Passion, but no formal institution exists to support their day-to-day needs. Questors sometimes live off the generosity of communities willing to support a strong questor in their midst, but most questors continue to practice the trade they learned in the early years of their lives.</p>\n<p>In contrast to adepts, questors are generally respected and trusted throughout the land. Because adepts draw magical power to themselves directly, most common folk are suspicious of them. Many view adepts, especially magicians, as presumptuous and arrogant. Questors, on the other hand, receive their power through the Passions. The people’s warm regard for the Passions includes their questors, and they therefore enjoy the trust of most people. An old Barsaivian saying perfectly expresses these sentiments:</p>\n<p>“Hide from magicians, hire adepts, and say ‘hello’ to questors.”</p>\n<p>Adepts who become questors must try to reconcile the lifestyle and mindset of their Discipline and the actions required of a faithful questor. For some, this is easy. Many Swordmaster adepts have assumed a quest to be like Thystonius. If the two ways of thinking conflict, however, the adept questor must choose which to follow. For example, this conflict could arise for a Thief who is also a questor of Thystonius. The Thief mindset typically demands that he avoid open confrontation, while the ideals of Thystonius drive him to seek it out. The more he relies on the Thief Discipline, the less he behaves like Thystonius, and so receives fewer rewards from the Passion. However, the more he tries to be like Thystonius, the less successful he will be as a Thief. It might seem odd for adepts to devote their lives to a Passion so different in nature from their Discipline. However, because the Discipline of an adept in many ways limits how the adept sees the world and how he interacts with it, becoming a questor of a Passion of a different nature allows the adept to interact with the world in a way previously unknown.</p>\n<p>The game rules for playing a questor, and the powers granted them by their patron, will be detailed in future Earthdawn products.</p>"},"_id":"WwOMME2QoOqA883h","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747832340,"modifiedTime":1671747854107,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"65ChPwIIOE7Br9no","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Spell Magic","color":"#ef0101"}},"pages":[{"name":"06. Casting Spells","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Magician characters who have learned spells by creating and using a grimoire, and who know the appropriate talents, can weave spell threads and cast spells. The process of spellcasting is straightforward, as shown below, but has the following limitations: </p>\n<p>Your character cannot cast every spell in this rule book. To cast a spell your character must first have learned the spell or else must cast it from a grimoire. Your character must also have the appropriate Thread Weaving talent for the Discipline of the spell.</p>\n<p>In most cases, the spell should be in a spell matrix. The other ways to cast spells— using raw magic or casting from a grimoire—are more difficult or carry higher risk to the caster and are not generally recommended except in extreme circumstances. To cast a spell from a matrix, your character must have achieved a Circle at least equal to the Circle of the spell being cast. Spells being cast from a grimoire or with raw magic can be of any Circle, including a Circle higher than your character’s current Discipline Circle.</p>\n<h4>Concentration</h4>\n<p>Once a spell has been successfully cast, the magician cannot usually end its effect until the spell expires. He must resort to other means (such as the Dispel Magic talent) to end the effect prematurely. Some spells, however, require that the magician (or spell target) concentrate in order to control the spell—either to direct the spell’s effect, or to maintain the spell and prevent it from expiring. Magicians must use their Standard action each round to maintain concentration. If at any time he stops concentrating on the spell, the effect ends. Injury to the magician may also break concentration. If a magician suffers damage while concentrating on a spell, he must make a Willpower test against the number of Damage Points taken. The magician may use his Willforce talent to add a bonus to this test, just as he can with spell effects.</p>\n<p>If the test succeeds, the magician keeps control of the spell. If the test fails, or the magician is knocked unconscious or killed, his concentration is automatically broken. A spell that expires through a loss of concentration may be cast again, but the magician must reweave any required spell threads, as normal.</p>\n<h4>Human Versatility and Spellcasting</h4>\n<p>The human racial @Compendium[ed4pgpl.talent-description.VYXCS0ECQw4FBRfD]{Versatility}talent, enables human magicians to learn the Thread Weaving talents of other magician Disciplines. This allows human magicians to cast spells of several Disciplines, though the range of spells a magician may cast in this manner is limited.</p>\n<p>When casting spells using a spell matrix, a magician who has learned another type of Thread Weaving through Versatility may only cast spells of Circles equal to his current Circle or his rank in the appropriate Thread Weaving talent, whichever is lower. For example, a Fifth Circle human Nethermancer uses his Versatility talent to learn Elementalism at Rank 4. The magician may cast Nethermancy spells of Fifth Circle and lower, but his Elementalism spells are limited to Fourth Circle.</p>\n<p>This restriction does not apply to magicians casting from a grimoire or using raw magic, as those methods do not have Circle restrictions under normal circumstances. Human magicians attempting to learn spells of other magician Disciplines usually have problems finding willing teachers. Most magicians are reluctant to teach the spells of their Discipline to adepts of other Disciplines. Indeed, many magicians feel it is a betrayal of the traditions and customs of their Discipline to do so. Such teachers may demand a higher payment in silver, require the potential pupil to perform some sort of task or deed for the teacher, or even require the student to swear a blood oath of some sort.</p>\n<h4>Targeting Spells</h4>\n<p>Spells aren’t like rocks thrown blindly in the dark, hoping for a hit; spells travel in an astral arc between the caster and the target. The caster can only create that arc if he can see (or otherwise sense) the target. Without the proper astral arc, the spell veers harmlessly into astral space.</p>\n<p>Sight is not the only way of targeting a spell, though it is the most common. Creatures whose primary sense is not sight may create the proper astral arc using that sense. Any method that makes the magician certain of the target’s location allows the creation of the proper astral arc. For example, a magician who is touching a target when casting a spell is certain of the target’s location, even if he can’t see the target. In the same manner, a magician can place an area effect spell at the end of his outstretched fingertips. Material objects between the caster and the target will not prevent a spell from reaching the target unless they block the magician’s line of sight. Targets receive a bonus to their Mystic Defense for  @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.zyBhQCJrx79W7Z7P]{Cover}, to reflect the increased difficulty of targeting them successfully. If the Spellcasting test succeeds any physical manifestation that accompanies the spell avoids physical obstacles to strike the spell’s target.</p>\n<p>Since most spells can only be directed at targets the magician can see, magicians must possess some sort of astral sight ability to cast spells at targets in astral space. If a magician successfully uses Astral Sight, he may target astral beings with any spell that can affect them. As a general rule, spells resisted with Mystic Armor affect astral beings. Spells resisted by Physical Armor cannot be used by a caster in the physical world against targets in astral space. For example, a Wizard using Astral Sight could cast a Mind Dagger spell at a spirit in astral space, but he could not cast a Flame Flash spell on the spirit. The effect of Flame Flash is physical—it will not affect the immaterial spirit.</p>\n<p>Magicians in astral space may cast spells against astral targets as if both the caster and the target were in the physical world. Magicians in astral space, however, cannot cast spells at targets in the physical world. See @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.iczS86SqzTx8GDmp]{Astral Space} for more information on astral sensing and the interactions between the astral and physical realms.</p>\n<h4>Observing Spellcasting</h4>\n<p>When a magician casts a spell, he uses his strength of will and awareness granted by his talents to gather astral energy and weave it into a predetermined form—a pattern— for a particular spell. The spell takes form on the astral plane, so an observer in the material world simply sees the magician concentrate, speak a few words and make some gestures to cast a spell.</p>\n<p>An observer with the Astral Sight ability, or an observer in astral space can see the spell form around the magician as he gathers magical energy and weaves it into the spell’s pattern. The patterns of simple spells form and execute their effects almost instantly. More complex spells take time to form, and astral observers can see the magical energy building as the spell is prepared.</p>\n<p>If astrally observing a spell as it is being cast, a character may recognize the spell by making a successful Patterncraft test against the spell’s Dispel Difficulty (magicians gain a +4 bonus to recognize spells of their Discipline). This knowledge may warn of a magician’s intentions, but generally do not give an observer enough time to prevent a spell from being cast.</p>\n<p>When a spell leaps through astral space toward its target, it moves very rapidly— too rapidly for characters to interfere with it. However, some Horrors and dragons have abilities that can counter spells.</p>"},"_id":"UXnmszNt9CLO6zTy","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747836513,"modifiedTime":1671747853695,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"7wbxrMs43UHoE5lV","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Weaving Threads to Magic Items","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Many magic items in Earthdawn are unique, produced by a conjunction of magical energy and emotion that imbues the item with magical powers. These powers are not enchanted into the item; they simply come into being when the item is involved in some significant event. It is important to remember that in Earthdawn, magic is life and life itself is magic. This means that because of magic, all the world is alive in one way or another. The forces of magic and life interact with each other, sometimes in distinct and subtle ways.</p>\n<p>The more significant events an item has been a part of, the greater its powers, and—usually—the greater its legend. The person using such an item rarely sees the full force of that power. A character who obtains the item can manifest its power by powering the item with a magical thread. Magic items powered in this way are commonly referred to as thread items, to distinguish them from items powered in other ways.</p>\n<h4>Pattern Knowledge</h4>\n<p>Thread items, by virtue of their creation (whether coincidence or design) all have True Patterns. An item’s True Pattern is a tangled mystery of history, facts, and magic. Before an adept can use the item he must unravel some of that mystery. He does that by using mystical talents, and by old-fashioned, mundane research.</p>\n<p>All thread items have a history integral to their power. Without knowing that history, a character is wasting his time attaching a thread to the item. He ends up pouring magical energy into the wrong place and the item’s powers remain locked away. By studying the item’s history, a character can learn its pattern knowledge, which allows the character to bring the item’s magic alive and make it work for him.</p>\n<p>The character does not need to learn all of the Pattern Knowledge—only some details which vary from item to item. For one magic sword he may need to learn the Name of the sword’s creator, and for another he might need to know the place where it was forged.</p>\n<p>An item’s Pattern Knowledge is made up of several pieces, known as Key Knowledges. Most thread items have multiple Key Knowledges, and the character must learn the knowledge at a given rank before he can increase the thread to that rank. </p>\n<p>For example, a magic ring may have three ranks; each rank provides a unique power and is tied to a Key Knowledge that the character must know to unlock that power. Key Knowledge must be learned and used in order; the Key Knowledge for first rank must be learned and the thread woven before the adept can use the second Key Knowledge, and both must be learned before the third Key Knowledge.</p>\n<h4>Key Knowledges</h4>\n<p>Characters can learn an item’s Key Knowledges through talents such as Item History or by researching legends, libraries, tavern lore, and other sources to find the information they need.</p>\n<p>Each of a magical item’s Key Knowledges has two distinct elements: the general type of information the Key Knowledge represents, called the Test Knowledge, and the specific details of that information, called the Research Knowledge.</p>\n<p>The Test Knowledge represents one or more general “questions” that can be determined by making a successful @Compendium[ed4pgpl.talent-description.839auhCIcI61JNJ8]{Historia przedmiotu}. Each Test Knowledge tells the character what he needs to discover in order to use the item. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The character must learn the Name of the fire elemental that helped to forge Kegel’s Sword.</li>\n<li>The character must learn the Name of the mountain that produced the ore used to forge Kegel’s Sword.</li>\n<li>The character must learn the last battle in which Kegel’s Sword was wielded. The Research Knowledge represents the specific “answer” to the Test Knowledge “question” that can only be learned through research or adventuring. For example:</li>\n<li>The Name of the fire elemental that helped forge Kegel’s Sword is Nogul.</li>\n<li>The ore used to forge Kegel’s Sword came from Mount Frost, in the Thunder Peaks</li>\n<li>Kegel’s Sword was last used in the Battle of Fornn during the last days of the Theran War, when Kegel used it to kill General Timyo, leader of the Theran forces.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>First Key Knowledge</h4>\n<p>The first Key Knowledge of an item is always at Rank One. This Key Knowledge contains the information that will give the character a starting place to learn the rest of the item’s Key Knowledges.</p>\n<p>A successful Item History test reveals the number of Thread Ranks the item or weapon has, how many threads can be woven to the item (how many different people can weave threads to it), whether or not the character is required to perform any Deeds to attach a thread to the item or increase the rank of a thread, and that he has to learn the item’s Name as the Research Knowledge.</p>\n<h4>Deeds</h4>\n<p>Some items require characters to perform Deeds in order to weave threads to them. A Deed usually relates to the history of an item; the character must perform a task similar to a task for which the item was once used, or complete a task left undone by a former owner of the item. Whether an item requires any Deeds is learned with the Rank One Test Knowledge, but the Test Knowledge of the Deed itself is learned at the Thread Rank with which the Deed is associated.</p>\n<p>Any Deeds associated with a magical item must be learned the same way as other Key Knowledges; a Deed listed at a Thread Rank is the Key Knowledge for that Rank. When a character makes the Item History test, he learns the Key Knowledge for that Thread Rank is a Deed, and the nature and objective of the Deed (the Test Knowledge). Performing the Deed provides the Research Knowledge.</p>\n<p>As with other Key Knowledges, a character must learn the earlier Key Knowledges before they can perform the Deed. For example, if an item requires a Deed at Thread Rank Four, the character must have learned the Key Knowledges for that item from Thread Ranks One through Three before performing the Deed. Deeds are treated as Key Knowledges for the purpose of Test and Research Knowledge; usually the previous Key Knowledges are learned before learning the details of the Deed anyway.</p>\n<h4>Obtain the Key Knowledge</h4>\n<p>To learn an item’s Key Knowledges, characters must first learn the Test Knowledges by making Item History tests.</p>\n<p><strong>Test Knowledge</strong></p>\n<p>A character using the Item History talent discovers the Test Knowledge for a particular Key Knowledge at a specific Rank. If the test result is high enough, the character may learn the Test Knowledge information for multiple Key Knowledges. This information does not give the character any advantage, however, until he learns the Research Knowledge of each rank.</p>\n<p>The Test Knowledge is the general “question” required for the Key Knowledge, not the specific answer. The Test Knowledge might be that the character has to learn the Name of the item’s creator. He does not learn the Name with his Item History test, only that he must learn this Name. The specific information required, in this case the Name itself, is the Research Knowledge, and must be discovered by more conventional means.</p>\n<p>To learn the Test Knowledge, the character makes an Item History test against the item’s Mystic Defense. If successful, the character learns one Key Knowledge for each success. A character can learn a maximum number of Test Knowledges from an item equal to his Item History rank.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Ulm Curvehorn is using his Rank 2 Item History talent to study a magic shield he found during his last adventure. After a week of study, he makes an Item History test against the shield’s Mystic Defense of 16 and rolls a 28—three successes! This would normally allow him to learn the first three Test Knowledges, but because he knows the Item History talent at Rank 2, he can only learn a maximum of two Test Knowledges. To learn more, he will need to improve his Item History rank.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>After a successful test, the character learns what he must research before he can weave the threads for those ranks. When a character learns the Test Knowledge of an item’s Key Knowledge, he also learns the magical effect granted at that rank. The gamemaster is free to determine whether the character learns the exact details at this stage or if he learns the general type of effect only.</p>\n<h4>Research Knowledge</h4>\n<p>Once the character learns a Test Knowledge, he must discover the Research Knowledge—the specific information required that allows him to to weave the thread. The Research Knowledge must be learned through mundane means; characters cannot use the Item History talent to learn this information. They must obtain it by researching legends, seeking lost kaers or citadels, finding historical tomes that contain the information they need, and so on.</p>\n<p>Exactly how this takes place is up to the gamemaster. Learning this information can occur as part of an adventure and integrated into a story, or it can be something that takes place between other adventures.</p>\n<p>In either case, the research required should not generally be resolved through a couple of Research tests, but should include some adventuring and roleplaying. The process can be simple and quick, or complex and arduous, depending on the nature of the item, the information to be learned, and the style of campaign the gamemaster is attempting to run.</p>\n<p>In short, finding the Research Knowledge answer for a Test Knowledge question should require some effort on the part of those seeking the knowledge. For example, a character may have to travel some distance to find a tome that has the information he seeks. Arriving at his destination, he might have to persuade the caretaker of the collection to allow him to look through the tome. To accomplish that, he may have to perform some task or favor for the caretaker.</p>\n<p>In the process of learning the Research Knowledge, the character should also learn how it fits into the item’s history. For example, if a character must learn the Name of the jungle that produced the wood used to create a staff, it is not enough for him to guess the Name of the jungle (even if he manages to guess correctly). The character may need to research different kinds of wood to pinpoint the exact type used to make the staff, learn about where different types of trees grow, then discovering important stands or forests of those trees. Through this process, he will understand the significance of the wood used to make the staff—if the information wasn’t significant, it would not be part of a Key Knowledge.</p>\n<p>Finding the information required to learn a Key Knowledge should be a challenge, but not impossible. More information and guidelines for the gamemaster on how to handle research and research-based adventures are presented in the Gamemaster’s Guide.</p>\n<h4>Spend Legend Points</h4>\n<p>Once he has learned the Key Knowledge for the next thread rank, the character prepares to weave a thread by spending Legend Points. This Legend Point investment represents the experience and effort the character puts into weaving the thread. The Legend Point cost of a thread item usually follows the progressions used to increase talent Ranks, but exactly which progression (Novice, Journeyman, Warden, or Master) depends on the item.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Mica, a dwarf Swordmaster, is looking to weave a thread to the magic shield Ulm has been studying. After successfully learning its first Key Knowledge, he must spend Legend Points to weave the thread. The shield’s description indicates it uses the cost progression for Journeyman talents, which means that Mica must spend 200 Legend Points to weave the Rank One thread. When he wants to increase the thread to Rank Two, he must spend an additional 300 Legend Points.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Weaving the Thread</h4>\n<p>Once the character has spent the appropriate Legend Points, he can attempt to weave a thread. The maximum thread rank a character can weave to an item is limited by his Thread Weaving talent rank, or the rank of the Key Knowledge he knows, whichever is lower. Threads must be woven in order— an adept cannot weave a thread for Rank 3 before he has woven the threads for Ranks 1 and 2.</p>\n<p>To weave the thread, the character makes a Thread Weaving test against a Difficulty Number based on the thread rank, as shown in the  Thread Weaving Difficulty Table. If successful, the character attaches a thread to the item’s True Pattern and the item’s ability at that rank is activated. When increasing the rank of an existing thread, the new thread replaces the old.</p>\n<p>If the test fails, the character cannot make another attempt at weaving a thread to that item for one day. The old thread—if one existed—remains in place. The Legend Points spent on weaving the new thread are gone; the character cannot use them for anything else. However, the adept does not need to spend Legend Points when trying again, as the points have already been spent to power the thread. As soon as a day has passed, the adept can attempt to weave the thread again.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Herekar makes a Thread Weaving test to increase the thread he has woven to the sword Tercel from Rank Three to Rank Four. The Difficulty Number for the Thread Weaving test is 11. Herekar spends the required Legend Points, and rolls an 8, failing the test. His Rank Three thread remains in place. The next day, he can try again by making another Thread Weaving test, but he does not need to spend the Legend Points again, as they were invested in the first attempt. </em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>As a character learns more about an item, he weaves a new, stronger thread at each rank. This new thread replaces the old, but maintains the powers and abilities of the old thread. A new thread cannot be woven until the character learns the appropriate Key Knowledge for the new rank.</p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align:center\">Thread Weaving Difficulty Table</h5>\n<table style=\"width:99.5956%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"background-color:#95a5a6\">\n<td style=\"width:42.6859%\">\n<p>Thread Rank</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:56.7146%\">\n<p>Weaving Difficulty</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:42.6859%\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width:56.7146%\">8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:42.6859%\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width:56.7146%\">9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:42.6859%\">3</td>\n<td style=\"width:56.7146%\">10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:42.6859%\">4</td>\n<td style=\"width:56.7146%\">11</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:42.6859%\">5</td>\n<td style=\"width:56.7146%\">12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:42.6859%\">6</td>\n<td style=\"width:56.7146%\">13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:42.6859%\">7</td>\n<td style=\"width:56.7146%\">14</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:42.6859%\">8</td>\n<td style=\"width:56.7146%\">15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:42.6859%\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width:56.7146%\">+1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>"},"_id":"ShI8D50ruwuu6gKE","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747834352,"modifiedTime":1671747853633,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"813iyTH3xezbcKtq","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

The sacrifice is represented by the character taking a few Damage Points to strengthen the magic of a talent, ability, or promise.</p>\n<p>Blood magic offers a vivid reminder of the torments people inflicted on themselves in the days before and during the Scourge. As a result, ordinary citizens often feel suspicious of adepts who use blood magic. Most Barsaivians work hard at putting the devastation of the Horrors out of their minds, and choose to reject everything that blood magic represents—even its potential for helping those still battling the remnants of the Horrors.</p>\n<p>Those who accept blood magic as a necessary means to achieve the greater good of destroying the Horrors often refer to this practice as “life magic” to stress the positive aspect of this magic and cultivate tolerance among the mainstream for those who use it.</p>\n<p>Some point out that blood magic can be used for both good and evil. While places like the Blood Wood offer an example of blood magic gone horribly wrong, others have benefited from life magic and suffered no ill effects. These individuals agree that blood magic offers great power, but also stress that such power demands great responsibility of those who would use it.</p>\n<p>Characters in Earthdawn may use blood magic in a variety of ways. Characters most commonly use blood magic to power certain talents, spells, blood charms and living armor. Characters may also use blood magic to enhance their talents or abilities, swear oaths or perform rituals. Characters may even use a special form of blood magic, known as sacrifice magic, to perform heroic feats, lay curses, or create True Patterns.</p>\n<p>Every use of blood magic requires a character to make a sacrifice, which may take the form of Strain, Blood Magic damage, one or more Wounds, or even his life. Unless otherwise noted, a character taking a Wound required by certain uses of blood magic need not make a Knockdown Test for that Wound.</p>\n<p>Strain damage suffered as a result of blood magic is recorded and healed in the same manner as other damage (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.mSo8GfCBa5CCXDm9]{Recovering from Injury}). Blood Magic Damage, however, is recorded separately, in the Blood Magic space on the Character Sheet. Blood Magic Damage is not healed by standard Recovery tests, and is not counted as damage for the purposes of healing Wounds, increasing talent Ranks, or other situations where the character must be uninjured. After its duration has elapsed, specified by the type of blood magic, Blood Magic Damage reverts to regular damage and may be healed normally. The duration of Blood Magic Damage is typically a year and a day, but for minor things, such as blood charms, the period may only be a day or until the charm is used. In some cases Blood Magic Damage is permanent, and should be recorded as a reduction in the character’s Death and Unconsciousness Ratings that is never recovered.</p>\n<h4>Blood Wounds</h4>\n<p>Some types of blood magic cause damage that may only be healed under certain conditions. In addition to this damage, some blood magic can cause a Blood Wound that can only be healed after a certain length of time, or by the use of a magical healing potion. Unless specifically noted, any Wound caused by the use of any form of blood magic is considered to be a Blood Wound, and can be healed after a year and a day. Some legends say that questors can heal Blood Wounds, but no evidence has yet been found to substantiate these tales.</p>\n<p>Blood Wounds, like other long-term Blood Magic Damage, do not prevent the character from increasing his talent Ranks or advancing to new Circles. Blood Wounds are otherwise treated as normal Wounds, affecting the character’s Action Tests and ability to heal damage (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.mSo8GfCBa5CCXDm9]{Wounds}).</p>\n<p>Use of a healing potion (or similar healing aids) to heal a Blood Wound may only be attempted after all other normal Wounds have been healed, and is not automatic. The character drinks the potion, and makes a Recovery (24) test—the Mystic Defense of a Blood Wound; the potion’s bonus is applied to this Recovery test, as normal. If the test succeeds, the Wound heals, leaving a runic scar. The potion does not heal any other damage the character may have; the magic is entirely consumed in the attempt to heal the Blood Wound.</p>\n<p>If the test fails, the Blood Wound remains, but the potion works normally, healing a number of Damage Points equal to the test result, minus the number of Wounds (including Blood Wounds) the character has.</p>\n<p>The runic scar from a healed Blood Wound is permanent, though it may be concealed with clothing, make-up, or illusion magic. Reading a runic scar using the Patterncraft talent reveals the reason for the Blood Wound scar.</p>\n<h4>Common Blood Magic</h4>\n<p>The following are all examples of “common” blood magic, practiced by adepts across Barsaive. Because the details vary from use to use, only a general overview is provided here.</p>\n<h4>Powering Talents and Spells</h4>\n<p>Many Earthdawn talents, spells, and Discipline abilities require blood magic in their use. The specific requirements are noted in the talent, spell, or ability description. Most blood magic in this category only causes Strain, but some abilities cause Blood Magic Damage, or even Permanent damage.</p>\n<h4>Powering Blood Charms and Living Armor</h4>\n<p>Blood magic is also used to power blood charms and certain types of living armor. These applications of blood magic usually cause the user Blood Magic Damage that cannot be healed until the item is used or removed.</p>\n<h4>Ritual Blood Magic</h4>\n<p>In ritual blood magic, a character draws magical power from a donor’s blood. In this rarely used form of blood magic, the power derived from the donor’s blood is used to create specific effects rather than enhancing other uses of magic. Examples of ritual blood magic include the high-Circle Nethermancer spells Create Life and Alter Life.</p>\n<h4>Blood Oaths</h4>\n<p>Blood oaths are one of the most significant uses of blood magic in Earthdawn. When swearing a blood oath, characters use blood magic to seal a promise. A character may swear a blood oath with any other character who holds at least an Unfriendly attitude towards him, though some blood oaths require a more favorable attitude. With the gamemaster’s permission, two player characters may swear a blood oath between themselves.</p>\n<p>Blood oaths can only be sworn between two characters at a time. There is one exception to this rule: a group of adepts can swear an oath of blood peace to their group as a whole as part of the ceremony to create a Group True Pattern (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.GhCDGKdxiDAEXPBA]{Group True Patterns}). If two characters wish to swear a blood oath with three dwarfs, for example, each character would have to complete the oath three times, once with each dwarf.</p>\n<p>Blood oaths must be sworn voluntarily, but if a character swears a blood oath while under the influence of magical charms, spells, or drugs (including strong drink) he is considered to have done so voluntarily. Blood oaths possess great power—regardless of circumstance, magic binds those who swear such pledges. There are tales of adepts who have sworn a blood oath while drunk, and regretted their carelessness. While blood oaths typically involve an even exchange of abilities or deeds, equally binding vows, or unceasing and active loyalty to one another, they may also be used to strike other important bargains.</p>\n<p>In general, blood oaths enforce the spirit of the agreement, rather than the letter. Most scholars are not sure why this is so, but many legends speak of scoundrels who somehow deceived others into swearing unevenly advantageous blood oaths, but these bounders always fare badly as a result, the lesson being that blood magic punishes the unjust user.</p>\n<p>Most blood oaths last for a year and a day. At the end of the oath’s duration, it may be renewed. Details on the duration and renewal terms of the different types of blood oaths are included with the descriptions below.</p>\n<h4>Blood Peace</h4>\n<p>A blood peace oath seals a truce between two characters. Any two living characters may swear a blood peace oath. A character may swear separate blood peace oaths with as many characters as he wishes, limited only by the number of points of damage the character must take for each oath.</p>\n<p>To swear blood peace, each character draws blood from their dominant weapon arm (t’skrang often draw blood from their tails), suffering 2 Blood Magic Damage. This damage cannot be healed as long as the oath remains in effect. Each character presses his weapon into the other character’s blood, and swears the oath as the blood dries on the weapon. The exact wording of the oath can vary, but all versions should include the elements contained in the following example.</p>\n<p>“As the sun shines upon the earth, so shall light illuminate my deeds. All people shall see that I mean no harm to [other character’s name]. I shall take no action to bring harm to him or those of his blood, or knowingly allow harm to befall [other character’s name] or those of his blood.”</p>\n<p>“As the moon shines upon the earth, so shall light illuminate my intent. All people shall see that I honor my promise.”</p>\n<p>By swearing a blood peace oath, two characters promise that they will never harm one another or allow harm to come to the other through inaction. A character who violates a blood peace oath releases the other from the vow. In addition, the violator’s Blood Magic Damage can never be healed, and he suffers a Blood Wound on the part of his body he drew blood from. This Wound lasts for a year and a day from the time it appears, and may be healed as described under Blood Wounds, above. If both characters keep their vow for a year and a day, the Damage Points taken for swearing the blood peace may be healed as normal damage. In addition, the scar on each character’s body from which he drew the blood for the oath becomes the color of gold or silver. Each character adds +1 to his Death Rating as long as both characters maintain their vow of peace. The characters lose this Death Rating bonus if either breaks the vow, but neither suffers any additional penalty for breaking the blood peace after the duration ends.</p>\n<p>If they choose, the characters may re-swear the blood peace oath after the first year and a day. If the oath is re-sworn, the 2 Blood Magic Damage may not be healed, and breaking the oath will cause the damage to become Permanent and a Blood Wound, as described above. While renewing the blood peace may not seem as advantageous, it represents a stronger commitment between the characters.</p>\n<h4>Blood Promise </h4>\n<p>Characters who swear a blood promise oath pledge to perform certain dangerous or heroic deeds. Any two living Namegiver characters with at least Unfriendly attitudes toward each other may swear a blood promise oath. Characters may only swear one blood promise at a time.</p>\n<p>To swear a blood promise, each character cuts their forehead, and their chest over the heart, drawing blood. Each character takes 4 Blood Magic Damage, which cannot be healed until both parties fulfill their promise. The damage becomes Permanent for characters who do not fulfill their sworn promise within a year and a day. </p>\n<p>Each character wipes the blood from his forehead with his left hand and the blood from his chest with his right hand. Facing each other, the characters press their hands together, mixing the blood. As the blood dries on their hands, the characters state their Names and recite their promises to each other.</p>\n<p>The characters should state their promises as similarly as possible. Each character must describe his pledged deed, identifying a talent or skill he will use while accomplishing it. The characters must also state the time period, not exceeding a year and a day, within which they must perform their deeds and meet after fulfilling their promises.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Herekar, the human Warrior, is trying to work out an arrangement with Larren, a Thief of poor reputation. Herekar needs the Tome of Maxxar, a book that is part of the Lost Library of Dyon. Larren needs samples of dirt from the Poison Forest. Larren knows where the Lost Library is, but refuses to share this knowledge. He also doesn’t want to go mucking about in the Poison Forest, so Larren and Herekar strike a deal. They agree to swear a blood promise and make the following oaths:</em></p>\n<p><em>“I, Herekar, promise to travel to the Poison Forest. There I shall obtain one belt pouch of soil. I shall be diligent in my efforts. I shall slay the dangerous beasts that dwell there with my Crushing Blow. I shall not delay, nor will I accept any other tasks until I have secured the soil. I shall return to this tavern before winter and deliver the soil to Larren. With him I mix my blood in promise.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“I, Larren, dwarf Thief, promise to travel to the Lost Library. I shall use my Stealthy Stride to tread through the halls softer than snow falling on a quiet night, and there I shall obtain the Tome of Maxxar. I shall not delay, nor will I accept any other tasks until I have secured the Tome. I shall return to this tavern before winter and deliver the Tome of Maxxor to Herekar. With him I mix my blood in promise.”</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>The blood magic of the oath supports the talent or skill named in the blood promise  by granting a +2 bonus to it. In the example above, Herekar would gain a +2 bonus to his Crushing Blow talent, while Larren would gain a +2 bonus to his Stealthy Stride talent. The bonus lasts for the duration of the promise, or until the promise is broken. The character applies the bonus whenever he uses the talent for the duration of the oath, whether the character is using the talent to fulfill the promise or for some other purpose. The characters must fulfill the promise within the agreed time or the oath is violated.</p>\n<p>If a character violates a blood promise oath he manifests two Blood Wounds, one on the forehead, the other on the chest. These Wounds last for a year and a day from the time the blood promise is broken, and will not heal naturally during this time. A character may attempt to heal the Blood Wound with a healing potion as described above.</p>\n<p>If both characters keep their promise, the skin (or scales or rock) on the characters’ chests from which they drew blood becomes the color of rubies or emeralds.</p>\n<p>When they meet after fulfilling the promise, the characters may immediately heal the 4 Damage Points that making the promise cost them. If they choose to heal this damage, they lose the bonus to the talents used to fulfill the blood promise. The characters may instead agree to heal only 2 Damage Points and make the increase to the talents used in their blood promise permanent. The remaining 2 Damage Points become permanent damage and can never be healed; subtract –2 from each character’s Death and Unconsciousness Ratings.</p>\n<h4>Blood Sworn</h4>\n<p>The most potent blood magic oath is the blood sworn oath. Only characters with Loyal attitudes toward each other may be blood sworn. Each character must have demonstrated the depth of his loyalty to the other at least three times by taking considerable risks for the benefit of the other character or otherwise behaving in a manner generally recognized as loyal. At least three years of loyal behavior must pass between the first loyal action and when the characters become blood sworn. A character may be blood sworn to only one other character.</p>\n<p>The characters begin the blood sworn ritual by cutting their forehead, and their chests over the heart, drawing blood. This causes 4 permanent damage that can never be healed—each character subtracts 4 from his Death and Unconsciousness Ratings. One character wipes the blood from his forehead with his left hand and presses his blood-smeared hand to the other character’ forehead and recites the first part of the oath. The other character repeats this gesture and the oath. The first character then wipes the blood from his chest with his right hand and presses that hand against the other character’s chest and recites the second part of the oath. The second character repeats the gesture and the oath.</p>\n<p>The exact wording of the oath can vary, but should include the same elements as the following example:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>First Oath:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">“As the sun rises each day, I shall think of you. As the stars shine each</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">night, so shall you be constantly in my thoughts. As night follows day, so closely shall</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">we share our separate lives. I shall know you as completely as you shall know me. This</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">I swear to you.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Second Oath:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">“As the blood of my heart touches yours, so shall I touch your feelings.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">As your heart beats against my hand, so shall your feelings touch mine. My loyalty</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">shall be yours. My courage shall be yours. The strength of my heart shall flow</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">through your veins. When there is need, I shall be strong for both of us. This I swear</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">to you. We are blood sworn.”</p>\n<p>The blood sworn oath lasts for a lifetime. Blood sworn characters must remain loyal to each other, protect each other and serve each other for the rest of their lives. A blood sworn character who violates his oath receives seven Blood Wounds that last for three years and three days after the oath is broken. After this time, six of the Wounds can be healed normally. One of the Blood Wounds, usually over the heart, remains unhealed, and no known magic can heal this final Wound. The character may attempt to heal the other six Blood Wounds with healing potions as described under Blood Wounds, above.</p>\n<p>Blood sworn characters gain several advantages from their oath. First, each character adds +2 to one Attribute value and +1 to a second Attribute value. These increases do not count toward the limits for Attribute improvement (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.p3z1efYBlscpDF8i]{Improving Attribute Values}). Second, each character gains +1 Rank in a talent called Blood Sworn, even if the character is not an adept. The Blood Sworn talent works like the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.talent-description.q8whHk4CtXp6ILpX]{Blood Share} talent, but it can only be used to transfer damage between the sworn characters. Characters can purchase ranks for this talent as a Journeyman level talent, but these ranks do not count toward the requirements for Circle advancement. The Blood Sworn talent provides one more power—it can be used to try and raise a sworn friend from the dead. The character’s rank in the Blood Sworn talent must equal or exceed the number of days his friend has been dead. One use of the talent must reduce the damage to the deceased to less than his Death Rating. The character gets one chance to do this; if it fails, he cannot try again. Using this talent to raise a dead friend permanently reduces both characters’ Death Ratings by one.</p>\n<p>Finally, blood sworn characters add +1 Rank to their Thought Link and Empathic Sense talents when using them to communicate with each other. If the characters do not possess these talents, they gain them at Rank 1, but cannot increase the rank of these talents and may only use them to communicate with their sworn friend.</p>\n<p>If one of the blood sworn characters dies and is not revived within a year and a day, any talents, or bonus talent ranks, gained from being blood sworn are lost. After this time, the surviving character may enter into another blood sworn oath, provided the displays of loyal behavior have happened since his former blood sworn friend died.</p>"},"_id":"XtqtOqklPTYbvay5","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747834433,"modifiedTime":1671747853653,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"8QbBiccot8kKMzXA","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Not all of them are Horrors.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">•T’lanthyn the Talespinner •</p>\n<p>Once, long ago, the land grew lush and green. Thriving forests sheltered plants and animals. It was an age<img style=\"float:right;margin:8px\" src=\"modules/ed4pgpl/assets/pictures/cover.jpg\" width=\"295\" height=\"446\" /> remembered today in the echoes of myth and legend. Magic was a part of life itself, filling the world and allowing people to grow and prosper off the land’s bounty.</p>\n<p>Then the Horrors came, and drowned the world in darkness.</p>\n<p>The world’s flow of magic rose and at its height dread creatures from the depths of astral space crossed into our world, leaving suffering and destruction in their wake. They laid our world to waste in a terrible time known as the Scourge. Lush forests died. Bustling towns vanished. Beautiful grasslands and majestic mountains became blasted, barren terrain, home to the Horrors’ twisted mockery of life.</p>\n<p>The Horrors lusted to destroy all life, but they did not succeed. Before their com- ing, the magicians of the Theran Empire warned the world. The people of the Earth took shelter in fantastic underground cities called kaers; their descendents grew up within these earthen enclaves, never seeing the light of the sun. For four hundred years the Horrors roamed the land, devouring all they touched while people hid in terror.</p>\n<p>Eventually the slow ebb of the world’s magic forced these loathsome creatures to retreat to the astral pit that spawned them. The people emerged slowly from their kaers, half in hope that the Scourge had truly ended and half in fear that the Horrors lingered. Though most of the Horrors have left the world, many remain, inflicting an- guish and suffering on other living creatures. As humanity struggles to remake the shattered world, they must combat the remaining Horrors who seek to prolong the destruction and despair of the Scourge.</p>\n<p>Now heroes travel the land, rediscovering its lost legends and exploring its changed face. For the world has changed, almost beyond recognition. Many people died during the Scourge; the Horrors breached some kaers and destroyed their inhab- itants. Other kaers remain sealed, from disaster or simple fear; their contents await discovery by bold explorers. Should they find folk still living within, these brave ad- venturers may lead such fear-darkened souls out to live again in the light.</p>\n<p>In the Age of Legend, heroes band together to fight the Horrors and reclaim the wounded world for those born in it. As they search the altered land for legendary cit- ies and lost treasures, they become the legends that will light the coming days. Tales of their deeds will live forever in people’s hearts. Heroes come to join in common cause from many paths. They come from many Disciplines, seeking honor and glory, and battle evil to redeem the world. A band of heroes may include an Illusionist, a magician who combines deception and reality to confuse those around him; a Sword- master, trained in the art of fighting with melee weapons; or a Beastmaster, able to train and command the beasts of earth and sky.</p>\n<p>The world holds countless heroes, but all share one trait: a willingness to fight to reclaim the world from that which threatens it. Through noble deeds and sacrifice, the heroes of the world will forge its future.</p>\n<p> </p>"},"_id":"QvDGRzoRVEMaWXSs","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747834818,"modifiedTime":1671747853344,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"9Rwe5OAcLdqQU8Zu","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Discipline Descriptions","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:center\">Racial Restrictions</h2>\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\">Optional Rule: Earlier editions of Earthdawn placed racial limitations on some Disciplines; characters of certain races could not follow certain Disciplines unless the gamemaster allowed an exception. Most of these restrictions were because a race’s culture did not easily allow one to embrace the worldview of certain Disciplines. These restrictions are summarized below. The gamemaster may enforce these if he wishes, or use them as a guideline for uncommon combinations of race and Discipline—either when filling his world with gamemaster characters or to require a more detailed background from a player with such a combination.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\">Obsidimen seldom become Sky Raiders or Air Sailors, as their deep bond to the earth urges them to stay on the ground. They do not normally get an opportunity to bond with a mount and become a Cavalryman simply because so few mounts exist that can carry them. The ways of the Archer and Swordmaster require a little too much finesse for obsidimen to follow them frequently; if they do, they favor weapons appropriate to their physique.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\">Trolls usually do not become Thieves, as their culture’s honor forbids them from stealing in secret, but dictates they take openly with a show of force. This stance is the way of life of highland trolls, but trolls integrated into other societies do not follow it.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\">Windlings seldom become Nethermancers, as their culture celebrates life, and contact with the afterlife is unsettling to them. They also seldom become Sky Raiders, as the way of the Sky Raider emphasizes physical prowess and brute force over cunning and subtlety.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\">Future Earthdawn products will introduce Disciplines that are restricted to a single race, rather than excluding specific races– for example, Disciplines that can only be learned by windlings or obsidimen. In contrast to the restrictions presented here, these future restrictions are suggested to be enforced, with only rare exceptions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Players are encouraged to use the information given in this chapter as a guideline. ow you, as a player, choose to portray your character is entirely your own choice! That is largely the point of roleplaying, after all. The individual Discipline descriptions detail the abilities provided to members of that Discipline. The next section describes how these different abilities are used in Earthdawn. </p>\n<h3>Important Attributes</h3>\n<p>Players with characters of this Discipline should emphasize these Attributes when creating their characters. Important Attributes include those on which many of a Discipline’s key talents are based.</p>\n<h3>Karma Ritual</h3>\n<p>The mindset required to practice a Discipline requires a lot of focus. As a result, all adepts practice a meditative rite, called the Karma Ritual, that keeps them in touch with the fundamental precepts of their Discipline. The adept can draw on this connection to provide an extra boost to their magical talents. This is represented in game terms through the use of Karma Points. Each Discipline includes a sample ritual that allows characters of that Discipline to regain Karma Points. The player need not make any tests to perform the Karma Ritual; it is always successful. Your character may perform his Karma Ritual once each day, and the ritual takes about half an hour to perform. After he performs his Karma Ritual, all of his Karma Points are restored. A character’s maximum Karma is determined by his highest Discipline Circle, multiplied by the Karma Modifier for his race. For example, a Third Circle human adept has 15 maximum Karma Points. While there are many similarities between the rituals practiced by adepts of the same Discipline, every Karma Ritual is unique. Individuals will adapt their ritual to fit their personal vision for the Discipline. Players are encouraged to create unique Karma Rituals for their characters.</p>\n<h3>Artisan Skills</h3>\n<p>Each Discipline lists some Artisan skills common to that Discipline. They are typically picked up during training to become an Initiate. For example, it is traditional for magicians to learn Robe Embroidery as an Artisan skill. Cavalrymen learn to take care of their mounts, and often learn the Braiding skill to braid their mounts’ manes. The Artisan skills listed are not absolute. Players can choose an Artisan skill not listed for their character’s Discipline. Under some circumstances, players may want to learn an Artisan skill normally unconnected to their Discipline; for example one picked up in their childhood, before training to become an adept.</p>\n<h3>Half-Magic</h3>\n<p>The Disciplines list examples or special uses for that Discipline’s Half-Magic tests. These are suggestions; it is up to individual groups to decide the scope of Half-Magic in their game.</p>\n<h3>Talents and Abilities</h3>\n<p>The most important part of the gifts conveyed by a Discipline come in the form of Discipline Talents, Talent Options, and Discipline Abilities.</p>\n<p>Discipline Talents form the core of a Discipline and are the same for all followers of that Discipline. A Discipline Talent is always available at the indicated Circle. An adept learns five Discipline Talents at First Circle, and an additional Discipline Talent each Circle thereafter.</p>\n<p>Talent Options are more versatile. At each Circle, an adept can choose one talent from a pool of optional talents, keyed to his status level in the Discipline (Novice, Journeyman, Warden, and Master). While Talent Options can be chosen from pools of lower status, the cost of advancing the talent is based on the Circle at which it was learned. Characters cannot fill a talent slot with a talent available in a higher pool.</p>\n<p>Discipline Abilities are magical abilities based on an adept’s Discipline—unlike talents, the adept has access to them as soon as he completes his training to reach that Circle, and can use it at any time thereafter. Discipline abilities come in many different types—Defense Ratings, special uses for Karma, free talents, or other special magical powers.</p>\n<h3>Durability</h3>\n<p>Durability increases the adept’s ability to take damage. At each Circle, the adept permanently adds the indicated Durability value to his Unconsciousness and Death Ratings. Remember that an adept’s Circle also factors into their Death Rating.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Based on his Toughness, Brighton the Troubadour has an Unconsciousness Rating of 28 and a Death Rating of 34. According to the Discipline description, Troubadours have Durability 5. At First Circle, Brighton adds +5 to his Unconsciousness Rating, giving him a 33. He adds +6 to his Death Rating (+5 from Durability, +1 for First Circle), bringing that up to a 40. This happens each time he increases his Circle. So when he has advanced to Third Circle, his Unconsciousness Rating will have increased to 43 (base value of 28, +15 from Durability) and his Death Rating to 52 (base value of 34, +15 from Durability, +3 for Third Circle).</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Free Talents</h3>\n<p>Some Disciplines are given a free talent upon gaining a Circle. This talent advances with the character’s Circle—he does not need to spend Legend Points to advance its rank. The talent does not count for the purposes of qualifying for the next Circle, but in all other respects behaves as a talent, including the ability to spend Karma on tests for that talent, and the ability to weave threads to them with thread magic (see the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.PwuBzh6bJlasTmd6]{The Workings of Magic} chapter).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Haldin is an Air Sailor. According to the Discipline description, Air Sailors get the Air Sailing talent for free. Haldin is considered to have the Air Sailing talent at a Rank equal to his Circle, and may spend karma when making tests using Air Sailing.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Spell Matrices</h3>\n<p>Spell Matrices are astral constructs used by magicians to safely cast spells. Magicians get two standard matrices for free at First Circle. These function like the talent of the same name, and their Rank advances with the character’s Circle, just as with other free talents.  </p>\n<p>Magicians also have different spell matrix talents available as Talent Options. These are purchased the same way as other talent options, and need to have their ranks purchased with Legend Points.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Tomas the Wizard learns two standard matrices at First Circle. According to the Discipline description, he has one more standard matrix available as a Talent Option. This means that if he wishes to spend his First Circle Talent Option to learn a third standard matrix, he can.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>For more about Spell Matrices and how they are used by magicians to cast spells, see the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.AtxJTCL2JMY6oDIu]{Spell Magic}chapter.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The sheer number of optional talents  gives a player enough flexibility for customization— characters of the same Discipline can be developed with a different focus. For example, one player could choose to create a stealthy Archer—a sniper—while another could make his Archer more socially competent. A player could even shift his focus as his character advances in Circle. But no matter what choices he makes, the character remains an Archer at his core. The limitation of one Talent Option per Circle ensures that the choices a player faces will be significant but not overwhelming.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Humans and Versatility</h3>\n<p>The Talent Options for a single Discipline cover only a fraction of all the talents available, leaving more than enough room for acquiring multiple Disciplines and the use of human versatility. The Versatility talent is the only way to learn talents from other Disciplines without resorting to additional Disciplines.</p>\n<p>A human can learn additional talents using the rules for @Compendium[ed4pgpl.talent-description.VYXCS0ECQw4FBRfD]{Versatility}. Talents learned in this way do not count towards Circle advancement, and the adept may not spend karma on them. The Circle of the talent is equivalent to the Circle at which his teacher learned it, and the character learning the talent must at least be that Circle to learn the talent.</p>\n<h3>Characteristics Bonuses</h3>\n<p>As your character advances in Circle, he automatically gains bonuses to some of his characteristics. Descriptions of these bonuses appear under each Circle. Defense bonuses permanently increase your character’s Physical, Mystic, or Social Defense by the amount listed. Only the highest bonus applies to a given Defense rating.</p>\n<p>Initiative bonuses permanently increase your character’s Initiative Step by the number listed.</p>\n<p>Recovery bonuses permanently increase the number of Recovery tests per day your character can make.</p>\n<p>Mystic Armor bonuses permanently increase the character’s Mystic Defense rating.</p>\n<h3>Karma Bonuses</h3>\n<p>Karma bonuses allow your character to spend a Karma Point on the types of actions listed for the ability. At higher Circles, characters gain another type of Karma bonus: they increase their Karma Die by one Step (from a d6 to a d8). </p>\n<h2>Discipline list</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[ed4pgpl.disciplines.BF3QR3VrTzf61Pj8]{Air Sailor}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[ed4pgpl.disciplines.PsAeAxqlNmvNAq5B]{Archer}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[ed4pgpl.disciplines.LdFIgoKpXfMG2t9h]{Beastmaster}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[ed4pgpl.disciplines.LdsYxpIqibHgD8al]{Cavalryman}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[ed4pgpl.disciplines.2pRv2kzivQvbRNyk]{Elementalist}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[ed4pgpl.disciplines.RK41oHwmiqZo0w4m]{Illusionist}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[ed4pgpl.disciplines.01B5Iz54YF2EZq8P]{Nethermancer}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[ed4pgpl.disciplines.FdSdUWAhoX2y4Qxa]{Scout}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[ed4pgpl.disciplines.nwUpBLBhVyHGGW8c]{Sky Raider}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[ed4pgpl.disciplines.Uy7fLbmEpjtP6bLE]{Swordmaster}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[ed4pgpl.disciplines.43uS5hD8GDNBx2w2]{Thief}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[ed4pgpl.disciplines.V3WSsI9vFwMkjbFB]{Troubadour}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[ed4pgpl.disciplines.IFTxUARpgIJ2fgBX]{Warrior}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[ed4pgpl.disciplines.9r99oFbdSokRbMW1]{Weaponsmith}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[ed4pgpl.disciplines.PclrmMof4RmAT9Eu]{Wizard}</li>\n</ul>"},"_id":"U5uuvZdqx38RzC6Q","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747834072,"modifiedTime":1671747853534,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"9haVVmCKEUrN0Hsj","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

A few specialize in the use of arcane powers called spell magic, and are known as magicians. These characters learn to create the patterns of spells and channel pure magical energy through those patterns to affect the physical world. This chapter describes the basic elements of spellcasting, gives the procedure for casting spells of all types, and warns characters of the dangers of certain ways of casting spells.</p>\n<p>About Spellcasting</p>\n<p>Characters can cast spells using one of three different methods. The three share similar elements, but each differs slightly from the others. The first, and most common method is referred to simply as spellcasting. The safest way to cast spells, this method requires the use of spell matrices, and is sometimes called matrix casting. </p>\n<p>The second method of spellcasting, raw magic casting, is the most dangerous. Using this method, a magician draws energy directly from astral space and channels it through his body. Raw magic casting usually serves as a last resort method of casting spells. For example, a magician has spell matrices available, but the spells attuned to the matrices are not the ones he needs. If he has no time to realign his spells, even by Reattuning on the Fly, he might risk casting raw magic simply to survive. </p>\n<p>Without the protection provided by a spell matrix, casting raw magic draws polluted energy from the astral plane. This frequently inflicts physical damage on the magician, and allows Horrors to locate magicians casting such spells and mark them. </p>\n<p>The last method is called grimoire casting. As its name implies, this method enables a magician to cast spells directly from a grimoire, rather than using a spell matrix. It is a slower and more difficult method than either matrix casting or raw magic. It is safer than raw magic, but still carries its share of risk. The various methods of spellcasting are detailed later in this chapter.</p>"},"_id":"rOXCJoQlz474fqtr","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747836330,"modifiedTime":1671747853667,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"AtxJTCL2JMY6oDIu","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

See @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.D8ZvvrgklfWL65QW]{Using Talents}, for more information on talents and how they work.</p>\n<p>The following conditions apply to increasing Talent Ranks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The character must be rested and in good health (not suffering any Current Damage or Wounds, except Blood Magic Damage).</li>\n<li>The character must meditate uninterrupted for eight hours. This time is needed for the character to remember his Discipline training, imagining how improving his Talent Rank would alter those lessons and exercises. Through meditation, he magically extends his initial training to incorporate the new experiences and knowledge within himself. The character can only meditate on one talent at a time.</li>\n<li>The character must not have increased the talent already that day. A talent can only be increased by one Rank per day. As he also requires sufficient rest, an adept can only increase up to two different talents by one Rank each per day under normal circumstances (up to two consecutive eight-hour meditation sessions, followed by eight hours of sleep).</li>\n<li>The character has sufficient Current Legend Points to pay the full cost of the new Talent Rank.</li>\n<li>The Talent and Skill Cost Table shows the Legend Point cost to increase a character’s Talent Ranks in his first Discipline (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.Advancing Disciplin Circles]{Learning New Disciplines}, for information on Legend Point costs for characters with multiple Disciplines). The character must pay the Legend Point cost for each Rank increase, in order. For example, a character with a Rank 2 talent must pay the Legend Point cost and advance to Rank 3 before he can increase to Rank 4.</li>\n<li>To find the Legend Point cost of increasing a talent to the next Rank, first determine at which Circle the talent was learned, then find the column on the Talent Cost Table that includes the Circle of the talent for your Discipline. In the Talent Rank column, find the new Rank you wish to purchase, then read across the row until you reach the appropriate Circle column. The number where the column and row intersect is the Legend Point cost for that Talent Rank.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Silar, a t’skrang Archer, wants to improve Avoid Blow from Rank 2 to Rank 3. Avoid Blow is a First Circle talent, so Silar’s player reads down the Circle 1–4 column until he gets to the Rank 3 row. The Legend Point cost listed for a Circle 1–4 talent at Rank 3 is 300. Silar meditates for 8 hours and spends 300 Legend Points to gain the new talent rank. He subtracts the Legend Points from his Current Legend Point total, and changes the rank of his Avoid Blow talent from 2 to 3.</em></p>\n<p><em>Girr, a windling Beastmaster, wants to improve Animal Talk from Rank 3 to Rank 4. Animal Talk is a Sixth Circle talent for Beastmasters. Cross-referencing the new Rank 4 with the Circle 5–8 column shows that it costs 800 Legend Points. Girr’s player notices that her Beastmaster has only 700 Current Legend Points, not enough to improve the talent rank. Girr must earn a few more Legend Points before she can afford to improve her Animal Talk talent.</em></p>\n<p><em>Ulm, a troll Weaponsmith, wants to improve Suppress Curse from Rank 6 to Rank 7. His player checks the table and finds this will cost Ulm 2,100 Legend Points. However, after his last adventure, Ulm took quite a bit of damage, including a couple of Wounds. While he has sufficient Current Legend Points to pay for the new talent rank, he must heal the damage before he will be able to meditate effectively.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Maximum Talent Rank</h4>\n<p>Rank 15 is the highest talent rank available to adepts. Some magical treasures, spells, or rituals can provide bonus ranks, bringing the effective rank above 15. Regardless of whether bonus ranks are temporary or permanent, the character improves his talent ranks without including bonuses from magical items or similar sources.</p>\n<h5

Sometimes you’ll be able to get what you need without combat. Sometimes you’ll have to fight for what you want. This chapter explains the mechanics for handling those situations in which your characters must fight to survive, and those times when they join battle for the sheer pleasure of matching skills against an opponent.</p>\n<p>Combat in Earthdawn happens fast and loose, allowing characters to perform a wide variety of actions. Swinging swords, casting spells, and intimidating your enemies are all just part of the action.</p>\n<h3>Combat Summary</h3>\n<p>Combat is conducted in a series of turns called combat rounds, or simply, rounds. Each combat round equals roughly six seconds of game time. The exact length of each round is usually not important to the story—it is simply a convenient unit of measure. During each round, your character can do a number of things: perform simple tasks (including movement), and use talents or skills that require different kinds of actions.</p>\n<p>To learn whether your character can successfully perform his desired actions, you will make one or more tests. After making an Initiative test to determine the order in which actions are resolved, players make an Attack test which, if successful, is followed by a Damage test. These, and the other kinds of tests that players make during combat, are described in the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.YlJzZ4afr5ggqdqz]{Actions}, and @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.mTjlUrKVIDJKEVh6]{Resolving Attacks} sections.</p>\n<p>The following summary outlines the general sequence that makes up a combat round. Each element is explained more fully later on in this chapter.</p>\n<p>1. Declare Intentions</p>\n<p>2. Determine Initiative</p>\n<p>3. Declare and Resolve Actions</p>\n<p>4. Begin a New Round</p>\n<p>Most of the following rules apply equally to player and gamemaster characters. Whenever a rule applies solely to a gamemaster character or creature it is noted. References to the term character refer to any player or gamemaster characters or creatures participating in the combat.</p>\n<h4>Declare Intentions</h4>\n<p>All characters declare the general type of action they intend to perform during the round, along with any @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.JpeeQJzSwc20goxP]{Combat Options} they intend to use. This doesn’t need to be overly formal. Combat options need to be chosen before Initiative is rolled because many combat options have effects that last the entire round, such as raising or lowering defense ratings.</p>\n<h4>Determine Initiative</h4>\n<p>Each round, characters make an Initiative test to determine the order in which their actions are carried out. Talents, spells, armor, and shields can modify the Initiative Step, as listed in their descriptions. A character’s Initiative Step cannot voluntarily be lowered below Step 1. A character whose Initiative Step is involuntarily reduced below Step 1—for example, through Wounds or magic— acts last in the round, with an effective Initiative of 1.</p>\n<p>Players roll their characters’ Initiative; the gamemaster rolls for other characters and creatures. The character with the highest result acts first, followed by the character with the next highest result, and so on. If two or more characters have the same Initiative, their actions occur at the same time and are resolved in whatever order the gamemaster prefers. One method of breaking ties is comparing the characters’ Dexterity values; comparing Initiative Steps is another. If a player character ties with a gamemaster character or creature, the player character should get to take his actions first—Earthdawn is a game about heroes, after all!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Take The Initiative</h4>\n<p><strong>Optional Rule:</strong> In large combats, which can take a lot of real time to resolve (thus slowing game play), the gamemaster may speed up the combat round by choosing not to make Initiative tests for gamemaster creatures or characters; he simply uses the Initiative Step as the test result.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Speeding Up Initiative</h4>\n<p>While players are usually responsible for a single character, the gamemaster is often required to keep track of multiple creatures or gamemaster characters. To simplify the Initiative process, it is recommended that the gamemaster make one Initiative test for groups of similar characters under his control. For example, it makes more sense to roll one test for a group of six identical ork scorchers than keep track of individual Initiative test results for each ork. On the other hand, if the group consists of five ork scorchers accompanied by a captain, the gamemaster may choose to make one test for the five ork scorchers and a separate test for their captain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Resolve Actions</h4>\n<p>Once the Initiative order has been determined, the characters declare the specific talents, skills, or spells they intend to use and whether they plan to spend Karma on any actions. They resolve their actions by making the appropriate tests and evaluating the results. This includes making Damage tests, spell Effect tests, and so on. </p>\n<h4>Begin a New Round </h4>\n<p>After all characters have resolved their actions, the round ends. If some characters wish to continue fighting, the next combat round begins.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Battle Maps And Miniatures</h4>\n<p>While it is possible to handle combat abstractly, with the action occurring solely in everyone’s imagination, the use of a hex-based battle map and miniatures can help visualize the fight.</p>\n<p>When using a battle map, we recommend that a hex be 2 yards wide. Any distance specified can be easily halved to determine the distance on the hex grid. It is usually best to round up to cover a full hex; if an effect has a range of 1 yard, it should cover 1 hex.</p>\n</blockquote>"},"_id":"S9QrlcDOQfY7oeNi","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747832903,"modifiedTime":1671747853786,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"CqPKhNuMY200mDlo","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

How he uses this energy is what defines his Discipline. Though the talents available to your character are limited by his Discipline, how effectively and creatively he uses them is only limited by your imagination.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-family:'ArnoPro Regular';font-size:large\">While all talents are magical, some talents are more blatantly magical than others. Some talents allow an adept to perform feats that non-magically gifted folk can only dream of. Others are indistinguishable from their mundane counterpart, but due to their magical nature are easier to learn and improve than skills.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-family:'ArnoPro Regular';font-size:large\">Talents draw on every aspect of the game system: tests, combat, spell magic, and so on. The brief explanations of these elements are referenced to the more complete explanations provided elsewhere in this book.</p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;font-weight:bold;font-family:WarhorseDIY;color:#191813\">Using Talents</h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-family:'ArnoPro Regular';font-size:large\"><img style=\"float:left;margin:7px\" src=\"modules/ed4pgpl/assets/pictures/knife-poses.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"145\" />When an adept uses a talent, he usually makes a test to determine how successfully he used that talent. This test can replace other types of tests, including Attack, Damage, or Initiative tests. The Step Number used for the test is usually determined by adding an Attribute Step to the talent’s Rank. The Difficulty Number can be found in the individual talent descriptions, but is often based on the target’s Physical, Mystic, or Social Defense.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-family:'ArnoPro Regular';font-size:large\">If a talent has an extended duration, a character can only be affected by a single use of that talent—multiple uses do not stack. If targeted by another use of the same talent, the character is affected by the greater of the two effects, and the lesser one does nothing (the adept still pays any required strain cost). </p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-family:'ArnoPro Regular';font-size:large\">A character can sometimes extend the duration of his talent effects by using the talent again on the same target. The duration is extended by the amount of the new result, but overrides any duration that might remain from the prior use, effectively ‘overwriting’ the prior use of the talent.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-family:'ArnoPro Regular';font-size:large\">Talents frequently manifest their magical nature through special effects—for example, Stealthy Stride deepens shadows and muffles the sound of the user’s movement. Some talents have distinctive visual cues or indicators, and these can be more noticeable if a character spends karma to boost their effect.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-family:'ArnoPro Regular';font-size:large\">Many of the talents listed in this chapter offer suggested descriptions and effects, but players are encouraged to customize or adapt those descriptions to fit their personal style and add flavor to the character’s use of their talents.</p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;font-weight:bold;font-family:WarhorseDIY;color:#191813\"> </h3>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;font-weight:bold;font-family:WarhorseDIY;color:#191813\">Talent Tests</h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-family:'ArnoPro Regular';font-size:large\">To make a Talent test (usually referred to by the name of the talent, i.e., Missile Weapons test), the adept rolls the dice indicated for the Talent Step against a Difficulty Number. For the test to be successful, the result must be at least equal to the Difficulty Number. If the result exceeds the Difficulty Number by a suitable margin, the adept may have achieved extra success levels, which could increase or otherwise beneficially change the talent’s effect. Unless noted otherwise, a character may only use a given talent once per round.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-family:'ArnoPro Regular';font-size:large\"> </p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;font-weight:bold;font-family:WarhorseDIY;color:#191813\">Replacement Effects</h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-family:'ArnoPro Regular';font-size:large\">Some talents replace or substitute their Step for a Step Number used in another type of test. For example, the Air Dance talent replaces the adept’s Dexterity Step with the Talent Step for the purpose of determining Initiative. If an adept has multiple talents that replace the same type of test, he can only benefit from one of those talents. For example. if the adept has two talents that substitute for his Strength Step for Damage tests (such as Crushing Blow and Down Strike), he would have to choose  which talent to use.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-family:'ArnoPro Regular';font-size:large\"> </p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;font-weight:bold;font-family:WarhorseDIY;color:#191813\">Talents and Concentration</h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-family:'ArnoPro Regular';font-size:large\">Some talents require concentration, requiring the adept to dedicate their Standard Action to maintain the effect. Unless noted otherwise in the talent description, this works the same way as maintaining concentration on a spell (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.7wbxrMs43UHoE5lV]{Concentration}).</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-family:'ArnoPro Regular';font-size:large\"> </p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;font-weight:bold;font-family:WarhorseDIY;color:#191813\">Special Uses and Exceptions</h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-family:'ArnoPro Regular';font-size:large\">The individual talent descriptions in this chapter give detailed rules for using each talent.

When an adept uses a talent, he may spend a Karma Point to roll a Karma Die, adding it to the test result. Spending Karma on a talent does not normally improve the result of any other tests that occur as a result. </p>\n<hr style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-family:'ArnoPro Regular';font-size:large\" />\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-family:'ArnoPro Regular';font-size:large\"><em style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">Bardin, a Warrior, is using his Melee Weapons talent to attack his opponent. Since Melee Weapons is a Warrior talent, Bardin may spend a Karma Point to increase his chance of success.

Unless stated otherwise, an adept can spend only one Karma Point when using a given talent, but sometimes multiple talents or other abilities can result in multiple Karma Dice being rolled on a single test.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-family:'ArnoPro Regular';font-size:large\">Adepts who follow multiple Disciplines may have talents that are available to more than one of their Disciplines. Regardless of how many Disciplines the talent is associated with, the adept may spend only one Karma Point on a single talent, unless otherwise noted in the talent description.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-family:'ArnoPro Regular';font-size:large\">If an adept has a Discipline ability that allows Karma to be spent on a particular type of test (for example, a Fifth Circle Warrior may spend Karma on damage tests in close combat), that ability does stack with talents used for that type of test. In this example, a Warrior using the Crushing Blow talent could spend two Karma on the test—one for the talent, and one for his Fifth Circle Discipline ability.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-family:'ArnoPro Regular';font-size:large\">A character may not spend Karma on a talent that is not part of his Discipline. This includes talents available as a racial ability—like a windling’s Astral Sight—learned through Versatility or granted by a magical item or other effect. </p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-family:'ArnoPro Regular';font-size:large\"> </p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;font-weight:bold;font-family:WarhorseDIY;color:#191813\">Dispelling Talents</h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-family:'ArnoPro Regular';font-size:large\">Because talents are powered by magic, player and gamemaster characters can interrupt or end an opponent’s use of a talent by using magic-disrupting abilities such as @Compendium[ed4pgpl.talent-description.UFpTwK0bVOjjPNoO]{Rozproszenie magii}. The Difficulty Number for dispelling a talent is based on the talent rank. Only talents with an extended duration can be dispelled this way. Some talents are more or less resistant to being dispelled—these talents note the Dispel Difficulty in their description. See @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.Ts3JsNe5mzodEHj4]{Dispelling Magic} for more information.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-family:'ArnoPro Regular';font-size:large\"> </p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;font-weight:bold;font-family:WarhorseDIY;color:#191813\">Talent Duration</h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-family:'ArnoPro Regular';font-size:large\">The effects of some talents vary in duration. Many talents have a duration determined by multiplying the talent rank by a given time unit (rounds, minutes, hours, days, etc.). For example, the effect of Engaging Banter lasts for a number of minutes equal to the adept’s Engaging Banter rank. In most cases, if the adept using the talent is knocked unconscious, the talent’s effect ends.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-family:'ArnoPro Regular';font-size:large\"> </p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;font-weight:bold;font-family:WarhorseDIY;color:#191813\">Talent Range</h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-family:'ArnoPro Regular';font-size:large\">Many talents have a variable range based on the talent rank, or a test result to determine a viable target, measure their effects, or determine the area affected.</p>"},"_id":"MyOjvGoz2R5jYbiN","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747837852,"modifiedTime":1671747853549,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"D8ZvvrgklfWL65QW","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Building Your Legend","color":"#afb201"}},"pages":[{"name":"07.01 Learning New Disciplines","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h4>Learning New Disciplines</h4>\n<p>Characters can learn additional Disciplines, sometimes referred to as “multi-Disciplining.” Remember that becoming an adept in the world of Earthdawn is not easy or automatic. A character who decides to learn an additional Discipline must master the new training methods in addition to retaining those of his original Discipline, and the new methods are often based on different philosophies.</p>\n<p>As a character advances through the Circles of his Discipline, he gains insight and his confidence grows. The stronger a character’s grasp of his Discipline, his understanding of magic makes it easier to learn a new one. At the same time, advancing in his Discipline requires a character to more closely adhere to its philosophies and traditions, making it harder to adopt to the style of thinking required by a new Discipline.</p>\n<p>This creates a bit of a paradox—as a character advances, it becomes easier and more difficult to learn an additional Discipline.</p>\n<p>To learn a new Discipline, a character must study with an adept of the desired Discipline. The character’s training in the new Discipline can only be imparted to him from a Fifth or higher Circle adept. Regardless of his prowess in any other Disciplines he may know, the character is being trained as an initiate into the new Discipline.</p>\n<p>Finding a master willing to perform an initiation into the new Discipline can present some difficulties. Many masters are reluctant to initiate characters who are already adepts of another Discipline because such students tend to be more independent, self-assured, and harder to teach than green recruits. Also, masters are frequently reluctant to initiate characters who practice Disciplines they consider unsympathetic or opposed to their own. They may require them to embark on a risky venture to prove their worthiness, or flat out refuse to teach applicants they do not like. Individual masters will have their own preferences and prejudices when it comes to other Disciplines.</p>\n<p>Another hurdle adepts may face when trying to learn a new Discipline is the fee charged by the master. The standard fee is 100 silver pieces for each Circle the student has achieved in other Disciplines, charged for each talent the adept needs to learn (see below). Some masters may charge more or less, based on their relationship with the student. Many masters will also ask for favors, deeds, or even blood oaths in addition to coin.</p>\n<p>Learning a new Discipline should not be a matter of simply coming up with the money; the gamemaster is encouraged to role-play the negotiation, and use favors and service to the master as adventure hooks.</p>\n<p>Learning a new Discipline is ultimately at the discretion of the gamemaster. If the gamemaster does not want to allow a character to learn a particular combination of Disciplines, there are ways he can make it difficult. A character who embarks on training in a new Discipline must devote considerable time to the effort. Experienced characters, who have accumulated obligations and enemies, may find it hard to find enough time to train. However, rather than simply deny the player the opportunity to develop his character the way he wants, the gamemaster should work with the player to find a solution.</p>\n<p>To learn a new Discipline the character must learn all of the First Circle Discipline Talents he does not yet know at Rank 1. The character must have enough Current Legend Points to pay for these new talents simultaneously. The Legend Point cost of purchasing a Rank 1 talent in a new Discipline is listed on the New Discipline Talent Cost Table. The character uses the lowest Circle among his current Disciplines to determine the Legend Point cost for a Rank 1 talent in the new Discipline.</p>\n<p>The Talent Option for First Circle can be learned at a later time, but all Talent Option slots for the new Discipline must be chosen from the Talent Options of that Discipline. The Legend Point cost for Talent Options are based on the Discipline they are being purchased for—even if they are available to multiple Disciplines as Talent Options.</p>\n<p>For each new talent the character wishes to learn, he must study with the tutor for 40 hours during the course of a week. A character learning two or more talents may spend considerable time training, but must study at least 80 hours per month to continue making progress. If a character fails to study his new Discipline for at least 80 hours a month, the training fails and the character must start over.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Mica, a Third Circle Swordmaster, wants to become an Air Sailor. Mica already knows two of the Air Sailor Discipline’s First Circle talents: Avoid Blow and Melee Weapons. Mica needs to learn the three remaining First Circle Air Sailor talents. First, he must find a Fifth or higher Circle Air Sailor willing to train him, then he must spend 40 hours in training for each talent he needs to learn (a total of 120 hours of training). Because the Swordmaster must study for a minimum of 80 hours per month, Mica must complete his training within two months.</em></p>\n<p><em>The New Discipline Talent Cost Table shows that Mica must spend 500 Legend Points per talent to learn this second Discipline—his lowest (actually, his only) Discipline Circle is 3, and he is learning his second Discipline. After spending 1,500 Legend Points to learn the three new talents at Rank 1, and paying 900 silver pieces to his master (300 silver per talent he needs to learn), the dwarf is now a First Circle Air Sailor as well as a Third Circle Swordmaster! </em></p>\n<p><em>Later in his adventuring career, Mica is now a Sixth Circle Swordmaster and Fourth Circle Air Sailor. He wants to expand his options by learning a third Discipline, and chooses to become an Elementalist. Again, after first finding a Fifth or higher Circle Elementalist willing to train him, Mica learns the four First Circle talents he does not already know: Elementalism (Thread Weaving), Patterncraft, Spellcasting, and Wood Skin. He already knows the Awareness talent, so does not need to relearn it. Four weeks and 4,000 silver pieces of training later (at 40 hours for each talent learned), Mica spends 2,000 Legend Points (500 Legend Points per talent, based on his lowest Discipline Circle and the fact that this is his third Discipline) to learn the four new talents at Rank 1. Mica joins the Elementalist Discipline as a First Circle magician.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Advancing In A New Discipline</h4>\n<p>The talents from the character’s first Discipline are improved normally (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.C0QyYIkycXSryUne]{Improving Talent Ranks}). The Legend Point cost for talents from additional Disciplines is determined by the number of Disciplines the character knows. The Equivalent Talent Circle Table shows the equivalent Circle range used to determine the Legend Point cost of talents from each of the character’s additional Disciplines. </p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Mica, a Sixth Circle Swordmaster, has also learned the Air Sailor Discipline to Fourth Circle, and most recently has taken on the Elementalist Discipline at First Circle. When advancing talents from the Swordmaster Discipline, Mica spends Legend Points as normal. Circle 1–4 talents from his Air Sailor Discipline are bought as if they were Circle 5–8 talents, and when he reaches Fifth Circle, those talents will be bought as if they were Circle 9-12.</em></p>\n<p><em>When improving the First Circle talents that he knows from his Elementalist Discipline, Mica pays for those talents as if they were Circle 9–12. When he becomes a Fifth Circle Elementalist, all of the talents for that Discipline from that Circle onward are bought as if they were Circle 13–15.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Discipline Talents the character can learn through multiple Disciplines are learned at the lowest Legend Point cost, provided the character qualifies to learn them under that Discipline by being of high enough Circle. They count as Discipline Talents for all applicable Disciplines and are used to qualify for advancement in all applicable Disciplines. Talents that have a variation for each Discipline, such as Thread Weaving, count as different talents for this purpose, and must be learned separately.</p>\n<p>Talent Options available through multiple Disciplines are handled separately. If a character has learned a Talent Option for a Discipline, he uses the appropriate Legend Point cost for that Discipline to raise the talent based on its Circle—even if it is available as a Talent Option at a lower tier for a new Discipline.</p>\n<p>If a character has learned a Talent Option that is a Discipline Talent for a new Discipline, that talent becomes a Discipline Talent as soon as the character qualifies to learn it from the new Discipline. From then on they use the Legend Point cost for the new Discipline. Until then it is treated as a Talent Option for the old Discipline. Once it becomes a Discipline Talent, the Talent Option slot is freed up, and the character may learn a new Talent Option from the old Discipline.</p>\n<h5 style=\"0text-align:center\\&quot;\">New Discipline Talent Cost Table</h5>\n<h5 style=\"0text-align:center\\&quot;\">—Rank 1 Talent Legend Point Cost—</h5>\n<table style=\"0width:99.3007%;height:90px\\&quot;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"0height:54px;background-color:#95a5a6\\&quot;\">\n<td style=\"0width:30.1642%;height:10px\\&quot;\">\n<p>Lowest Circle Attained</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"0width:22.2298%;height:10px\\&quot;\">\n<p>Second Discipline</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"0width:18.6008%;height:10px\\&quot;\">\n<p>Third Discipline</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"0width:18.4319%;height:10px\\&quot;\">\n<p>Fourth+ Disciplines</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"0height:16px\\&quot;\">\n<td style=\"0width:30.1642%;height:16px\\&quot;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"0width:22.2298%;height:16px\\&quot;\">1300</td>\n<td style=\"0width:18.6008%;height:16px\\&quot;\">2100</td>\n<td style=\"0width:18.4319%;height:16px\\&quot;\">3400</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"0height:16px\\&quot;\">\n<td style=\"0width:30.1642%;height:16px\\&quot;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"0width:22.2298%;height:16px\\&quot;\">800</td>\n<td style=\"0width:18.6008%;height:16px\\&quot;\">1300</td>\n<td style=\"0width:18.4319%;height:16px\\&quot;\">2100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"0height:16px\\&quot;\">\n<td style=\"0width:30.1642%;height:16px\\&quot;\">3</td>\n<td style=\"0width:22.2298%;height:16px\\&quot;\">500</td>\n<td style=\"0width:18.6008%;height:16px\\&quot;\">800</td>\n<td style=\"0width:18.4319%;height:16px\\&quot;\">1300</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"0height:16px\\&quot;\">\n<td style=\"0width:30.1642%;height:16px\\&quot;\">4</td>\n<td style=\"0width:22.2298%;height:16px\\&quot;\">300</td>\n<td style=\"0width:18.6008%;height:16px\\&quot;\">500</td>\n<td style=\"0width:18.4319%;height:16px\\&quot;\">800</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"0height:16px\\&quot;\">\n<td style=\"0width:30.1642%;height:16px\\&quot;\">5+</td>\n<td style=\"0width:22.2298%;height:16px\\&quot;\">200</td>\n<td style=\"0width:18.6008%;height:16px\\&quot;\">300</td>\n<td style=\"0width:18.4319%;height:16px\\&quot;\">500</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Mica knows the Avoid Blow talent from his first Discipline: Swordmaster.

For example, a Fifth Circle Wizard who later becomes a Sky Raider has gained a +3 bonus to his Unconsciousness and Death Ratings at First Circle. When he completes his initiation into the Sky Raider Discipline, he gains the benefit of the Sky Raider Durability Rating of +7 (effectively gaining an additional +4 to each Health Rating). When he advances to Second Circle Sky Raider, he once again uses the highest Durability rating, gaining another +4 to his Unconsciousness and Death Ratings. </p>\n<h4>Characteristics Bonuses</h4>\n<p>Bonuses to Defense Ratings do not stack across multiple Disciplines. He only uses the highest bonus from each Discipline. For example, when a Sixth Circle Archer advances to Second Circle as a Scout, he does not receive the +1 bonus to his Physical Defense granted by the Scout Discipline; he already has a +2 Physical Defense bonus as an Archer. If, instead, that character were a Second Circle Swordmaster, he would receive the +1 bonus to his Social Defense as he does not have any Social Defense bonus as a Sixth Circle Archer.</p>\n<h4>Karma</h4>\n<p>If multiple Disciplines grant the ability to spend Karma on a particular kind of test, the character may only spend one Karma Point using that ability. For example, a Fifth Circle Air Sailor who is also a Third Circle Swordmaster may only spend one point using the ability to spend Karma on Interaction tests. Unless a rule description specifically says otherwise, this applies to any talents or duplicate abilities.</p>\n<h4>Versatility</h4>\n<p>The Versatility racial ability allows human adepts to learn talents from outside their Disciplines, but it does not make it easier for human characters to learn additional Disciplines. When a human character learns a new Discipline for which he already knows one or more talents through Versatility, he must relearn those talents and purchase Rank 1 in each—he is considered to not know these talents for the purpose of learning a new Discipline. The Legend Point cost is determined as normal, based on his current Disciplines.</p>\n<p>Over time, the character will repurchase all Talent Ranks up to the Rank he acquired through Versatility. Once he has done so, he may learn a new talent through Versatility; effectively that Versatility “slot” is freed up for re-use. Until that point, the character essentially knows the same talent at two different Ranks, and players should differentiate between them on their Character Sheet. A character who knows the same talent at two different Ranks may use either the Versatility or the Discipline talent.</p>\n<p>\"</p>"},"_id":"ux4Nt37ouaLApISw","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747837179,"modifiedTime":1671747854059,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"DEfSKsTueiE1bXhE","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

The creature or character must use the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.0HbEVYqjIzZ40xAH]{Splitting Movement} combat option.</p>\n<p>The attacker flies into close combat using a portion of his Movement Rate, makes his attacks, and flies off using the remainder of his Movement Rate. Characters who wish to attack swooping creatures or characters in close combat must have a higher Initiative than their opponent that round and use a @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.YlJzZ4afr5ggqdqz]{Reserved Action} to intercept the attacker.</p>\n<p><strong>Mounted Aerial Combat</strong></p>\n<p>Mounted combat involving flying mounts is handled the same as other mounted combat. The rider may make swooping attacks just as any other flying creature or character, and may make flying charging attacks per the same rules. The mechanics for handling attack and defense are the same for mounted combat involving split movement and swooping attacks. The major difference is the result of failed Knockdown tests by characters riding flying creatures, as described below.</p>\n<p><strong>Knockdown</strong></p>\n<p>Flying creatures and characters can be knocked out of the sky. A flying character or creature who fails a Knockdown test is knocked to the ground and may take falling damage based on the distance fallen. Once the character or creature stands back up it can again take to the air. If a character riding a flying mount fails a Knockdown test and is knocked off his mount, he receives falling damage based on the distance fallen instead of the normal Step 5/D8 damage for a land-based mount. Many riders of flying mounts strap themselves into the saddle to limit this danger.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>Long Falls</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Optional Rule: </strong>The gamemaster may decide that a creature or character flying at a considerable height or with special physical properties or features does not hit the ground after failing a Knockdown test. Instead, they plummet towards the ground over several rounds. There are no simple rules to determine how fast a creature falls each round; variables include body weight, wind, wings that might slow the descent, and so on. Flying creatures and characters that have been knocked down, but haven’t yet hit the ground, can spend their Standard action to make a Dexterity (6) test to “stand up”. If the test succeeds, the creature or character stops falling.</p>\n<p>A creature or character that is unconscious and falling makes a Recovery test after one round of uncontrolled descent, as if he were being roused by another character (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.mSo8GfCBa5CCXDm9]{Recovering from Injury}. If the creature or character manages to regain consciousness, he can attempt to make the Dexterity (6) Test to “stand up” as noted earlier, otherwise he continues to fall until he hits the ground or is somehow rescued.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>"},"_id":"Lq6mzxcTF2lhnDBh","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747833512,"modifiedTime":1671747853948,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"E5X97Bbqp6vWPoRP","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

As with a weapon’s Strength minimum, above, characters who don’t meet this requirement can still use the weapon, but are penalized. A character who does not meet the minimum Dexterity value required for using the weapon suffers a –1 penalty to Attack tests made with that weapon for every point of Dexterity he lacks.</p>\n<h4>Attached Weapons</h4>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, weapons attached to a character’s body in one way or the other—whether a gauntlet, a boot with a nasty spike, or a weapon attached to a t’skrang’s tail—are used with the Unarmed Combat talent or skill. They are still considered weapons and can be targeted as such by talents such as Disarm or Riposte, or by spells or abilities that target or enhance weapons.</p>\n<h4>Repairing Damaged Weapons</h4>\n<p>Some effects can damage a weapon, measured by reducing its Damage Step. If a weapon’s Damage is reduced to 0 it is destroyed. Repairing a damaged weapon requires one day for each Damage Step lost. Repair costs are approximately 10 percent of the price for a new weapon of the same type per Step repaired (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.oDmRDpE1aQxbxYIA]{Services}).

Workings of Magic","color":"#029720"}},"pages":[{"name":"08. Group True Patterns","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Thread magic can be used by groups of people in a special, unique way. By deliberately creating a True Pattern for the group, the members of that group can weave threads to the Group True Pattern and strengthen their abilities when interacting with the group by acting as a part of it. This use of thread magic is usually practiced by adventuring groups, but other groups are known to use it as well. It is believed, for example, that the Hand of Corruption has created its own True Pattern, enabling its members to enhance their abilities with thread magic when acting for the Hand’s purposes.</p>\n<p>This works because the Group True Pattern is a separate entity, independent from any of its members, so it can grant magical benefit to those interacting with it via thread magic.</p>\n<h4>Creating a Group True Pattern</h4>\n<p>Just as people, places, and things can have Names, so can groups of people. If all the members of a group can agree upon a Name for the group, that Name can form a True Pattern that represents all that the group is, just like other True Patterns. This process is not easy, and requires that the group fulfill the following conditions, in order:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The group chooses a Name for itself which represents the group’s past, present, and future.</li>\n<li>The group’s members create a symbol which represents the group and its history.</li>\n<li>Each member of the group creates an item representing the group and that character’s role in it; this item becomes a Minor Pattern Item for the group.</li>\n<li>The group is Named during a specific Naming ritual, beginning the formation of the group’s True Pattern.</li>\n<li>The group’s members perform a Group Oath of Blood Peace, concluding the formation of the Group True Pattern.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Choose a Group Name</h4>\n<p>The group must choose a Name. All the members must agree to the chosen Name. The Name can be anything, but will always represent a part of the group’s past, present, or future. Many groups are Named for the character who first gathered the group together.</p>\n<p>Tomas and his companions wish to create a group True Pattern. They decide they will be Named “The Storm Riders” because of a cryptic prophecy they were given by the Shivalahala Syrtis.</p>\n<h4>Choose a Group Symbol</h4>\n<p>A group symbol is a small picture or diagram that is a visual representation of the group. Like a group Name, the symbol must represent the group in some way. The Storm Riders decide that their group symbol is going to be the silhouette of an airship against a dark cloud with a lightning bolt coming out of the bottom.</p>\n<h4>Create Symbolic Items</h4>\n<p>Once the group chooses a Name and symbol for itself, each member must create an item that represents the group and his role in it. Carving the group symbol into the item is one way to ensure that the item represents the group. </p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Ulm is a troll Weaponsmith and a member of the Storm Riders. Ulm must create an item that represents the group and his role in it. He chooses the hammer from his traveling tools as his symbolic item. The hammer is one that Ulm uses to do minor repairs on the group’s weapons and armor while they travel. The hammer represents Ulm’s role in the group, and the group itself, because the hammer is used during Ulm’s adventures with the group.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>The example above is just one possibility of a symbolic character or group item. Players are encouraged to use their imagination when creating these items. Though almost any item is viable, the gamemaster is the final arbiter of whether it is an acceptable item, as it will become a Pattern Item for the Group True Pattern.</p>\n<h4>Perform the Naming Ritual</h4>\n<p>Once the group Name and symbol are chosen and each member has created his symbolic item, the group performs the Naming ritual. The ritual involves one member acting as the leader, who states the Name of the group and that its symbol will represent the group. Then each member, starting with the leader, presents himself and the item he has chosen to the group. The ritual can vary, but a commonly used ritual goes as follows:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>“This assembly shall be Named [Group Name]. This symbol represents our present,</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>past, and future, and will be known across all of Barsaive as that of [Group Name].</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>I am Named [character Name]. This [character’s item] represents my loyalty to this</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>assembly. I am forever a part of [Group Name].”</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"> </p>\n<p>Each member in turn recites his Name, symbolic item, and his loyalty to the group. After the last member has done so, the leader then invites the members to swear an oath of Blood Peace.</p>\n<h4>Group Oath of Blood Peace</h4>\n<p>The last Step in creating a Group True Pattern involves Blood Magic. Each of the members must swear a special oath of Blood Peace to the group. The section on @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.8QbBiccot8kKMzXA]{Blood magic} provides information about the Blood Peace oath, but a few important distinctions need to be made here. The oath is made to the group as a whole, not to each individual member of the group. This means that each member only takes 2 points of damage from the oath of Blood Peace, not 2 points for each member of the group.</p>\n<p>When the members of the group complete the oath of Blood Peace, the group’s True Pattern forms, and the individual characters’ symbolic items become Minor Pattern Items for the Group True Pattern. From then on it behaves the same way as any other True Pattern; it represents everything about the group, it can be accessed via one of its Pattern Items, and threads can be woven to it.</p>\n<h4>Group Continuation</h4>\n<p>To benefit from the Group True Pattern, characters must keep true to their oath of Blood Peace and renew their oath at the end of its duration. If a member fails to renew the oath, he has to re-join the group (see Adding New Members below). If none of the members renew their Oath, the Group True Pattern dissolves, and all benefits associated with it are lost.</p>\n<p>While the group oath of Blood Peace has to be renewed like a regular Blood Peace oath, characters never gain a bonus to Death Rating as they gain from normal Blood  Peace oaths.</p>\n<p>If a character dies and is not brought back to life, the surviving members of the group can still benefit from the Group True Pattern. If the dead character is brought back to life in the future, he must re-join the group and re-weave threads to the Pattern Item to benefit from it (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.xBUKOLoeOQQOPdUh]{Losing Threads}). The Group True Pattern is a separate magical entity, so the death of a single member does not destroy it.</p>\n<p>The dead character’s group pattern item keeps its status; it is associated with the group, and could be used against the group like any other pattern item—indeed, it is likely that the death of a member could become important pattern knowledge for the group.</p>\n<h4>Adding New Members</h4>\n<p>If a group decides to add new members, its members perform the Naming ritual again, this time including the new members in the rite. New members must create a symbolic item and take the Group Oath of Blood Peace. After the Naming ritual, the Group True Pattern is changed to reflect the new members. </p>\n<p>Just the same, members who missed a renewal ceremony or died and lost their threads to the Group True Pattern can re-join the group as if they were new members, but need not create a new Pattern Item (as the pattern item they created still exists). Current members of the group do not take additional Blood Magic Damage from performing the ritual again, since they are already a part of the group, although any new members joining the group do (see Group Oath of Blood Peace).</p>\n<h4>Key Knowledges of Group Pattern Items</h4>\n<p>Because the members of a group create Pattern Items for the group, those Pattern Items hold Key Knowledges about the Group True Pattern. This has two important consequences. First, members of the group already know the Key Knowledges required to weave threads to the Group True Pattern.</p>\n<p>Second, non-group characters can use these Pattern Items against the group, just as with Pattern Items of people and places. If another character obtains a Group Pattern Item, that individual can learn the Key Knowledges held by the item, which always contain the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Name of the group.</li>\n<li>The Names of each of the group’s members.</li>\n<li>The Name of the character who created the Pattern Item.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a character loses his Group Pattern Item, he cannot weave more threads to the Group True Pattern, and any threads already woven will lose their benefit until he recovers the item. </p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align:center\">Group True Pattern Legend Point Cost Table</h5>\n<table style=\"width:95.9036%;height:90px\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"background-color:#95a5a6\">\n<td style=\"width:42.6992%;height:10px\">\n<p>Thread Rank</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:56.5845%;height:10px\">\n<p>Legend Point Cost</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:42.6992%;height:16px\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width:56.5845%;height:16px\">300</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:42.6992%;height:16px\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width:56.5845%;height:16px\">500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:42.6992%;height:16px\">3</td>\n<td style=\"width:56.5845%;height:16px\">800</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:42.6992%;height:16px\">4</td>\n<td style=\"width:56.5845%;height:16px\">1300</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:42.6992%;height:16px\">5</td>\n<td style=\"width:56.5845%;height:16px\">2100</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>Weaving Threads to Group True Patterns </h4>\n<p>Members of a group that have created a Group True Pattern can weave threads from their individual True Patterns to the Group True Pattern. These threads can be used to enhance a character’s talents or characteristics while they are interacting with the group.</p>\n<p>This is possible because the magical energy of the Group True Pattern is empowering those who weave threads to it through its Pattern Items. However, when the character is acting on his own, such as for personal gain unrelated to any intentions of the rest of his group, he gains no benefit from threads he has woven to the Group True Pattern.</p>\n<p>Weaving threads to the Group True Pattern is the same as weaving threads to other True Patterns, except that a character already has the necessary Key Knowledge. This leaves only two steps for weaving threads: Spending Legend Points and Weaving the Thread.</p>\n<h4>Spending Legend Points</h4>\n<p>When a character wants to weave a thread to a Group True Pattern, he must prepare  the thread by spending Legend Points. The Legend Point cost for Thread Ranks woven to a Group True Pattern is the same as for a Warden talent, as shown in the Group True Pattern Legend Point Cost Table. Once a character spends the required Legend Points, he can attempt to weave the thread to the Group True Pattern.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>In Friendly Or In Enemy Hands</h4>\n<p>Unlike other Pattern Items, Pattern Items for Group True Patterns work differently for different characters.</p>\n<p>Characters that are members of the group gain their bonuses while interacting with the group (acting as a part of it or on its behalf), but cannot boost the effectiveness of the group as a whole. For normal Pattern Items used to boost someone else’s abilities, there is a specific target for the thread. For example, an Archer weaving a thread to the Pattern Item of his Warrior friend can specify that Warrior’s Physical Defense as a target to boost it. In case of a group, though, there is no specific ability that can be a target for the thread; the Group True Pattern is not a Physical being, but an immaterial and intangible entity. While its members boast viable targets for such a thread (they all have a Physical Defense, for example), a single thread could not be attached to multiple targets. In other words, a Group True Pattern is something a member can draw power from and channel it toward his own ends, but power cannot be channeled into a Group True Pattern.</p>\n<p>Characters that are not members of the group can use its Pattern Items in the same way as other Pattern Items, but with greater efficiency. If an enemy or outside ally of the group obtains the Group Pattern Item of just one of its members, and then weaves a thread to it and ties it to one of his abilities, that ability is boosted when interacting with any member of the group. For example, a Nethermancer tying the thread to his Spellcasting talent gains a bonus to his Spellcasting talent whenever he casts a spell against a member of the group. Whether this is a good or bad thing depends on the Nethermancer’s attitude towards the group. An enemy Nethermancer can use the bonus to better attack the group, but a friendly Nethermancer would use it to increase the effectiveness of beneficial spells on the group’s members. </p>\n<p>Members of a group are well advised to keep a close watch on Group Pattern Items of previous members. If a member dies, his Pattern Item is still a Pattern Item for the whole group. It can be given to allies, but must be kept away from enemies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Weaving the Thread</h4>\n<p>As with other thread magic, the character makes a Thread Weaving test against a Difficulty Number based on the Rank of the thread being woven @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.IaaGSm6ifefyQW0j]{07. Weaving Threads to Pattern items}.</p>\n<p>If the test succeeds, the thread is attached; if the test fails, the character must wait for a day before he can try again. Because the Pattern Items for a Group True Pattern are Minor Pattern Items, an extra success is needed on the Thread Weaving test to weave the thread, just like Minor Pattern Items for other people and places.</p>\n<h4>Group True Pattern Thread Limits</h4>\n<p>Though thread magic usually has a limit of one thread per Pattern Item, this limit does not apply when weaving threads to a Group True Pattern. Because a character is integral to the pattern of his group, he can have a maximum of five threads woven to his own Group True Pattern, though each thread is still limited to Rank 5. Each thread can be attached to a different talent or characteristic, and otherwise works the same way as other threads woven to pattern items.</p>\n<p>Someone acquiring a pattern item for a group he is not a member of is still restricted to a single thread.</p>"},"_id":"2EJedeugznXMtRMw","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747834405,"modifiedTime":1671747853647,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"GhCDGKdxiDAEXPBA","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Knowledge Skills","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Your character has lived in the world of Earthdawn for his entire life, and so he will know more about it than you possibly can. Knowledge skills represent that experience. They serve two main purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They simulate your character’s knowledge of the world. The gamemaster reveals or adds to this knowledge when it will advance the story.</li>\n<li>They allow you to further define your character, giving him unique quirks and interests.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In a game session, Knowledge skills can come into play when something your character might know would help you make an informed choice about what to do next. Your character may know a tremendous amount about the world of Earthdawn, but you, the player, will only learn that knowledge when the story dictates the need. </p>\n<h3>Using Knowledge Skills</h3>\n<p>Using Knowledge skills is the same as using other skills. The exact nature of each Knowledge skill can have a narrow focus or broad perspective, and knowledge of any area may cover huge amounts of information with different levels of insight. As a result, there are different ways for players and gamemasters to use Knowledge skills during the game, and different ways to interpret Knowledge skill test results.</p>\n<p>A character typically uses a Knowledge skill in one of two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To determine if he knows a specified fact.</li>\n<li>To see how much about a given subject he knows.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both ways require a Knowledge test to be made. Learning a specific fact involves beating a given Difficulty Number. Finding what body of knowledge a character has is an open roll, with higher results representing more knowledge. The use of Knowledge skills does not reflect a character’s only knowledge about any given situation. It is remembering the right thing at the right moment, or drawing conclusions between knowledge and situation. As such, a character may know something he failed to “remember” earlier.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/ed4pgpl/assets/pictures/studying-bored.jpg\" width=\"549\" height=\"263\" /></p>\n<h3>Making Knowledge Tests</h3>\n<p>When making a Knowledge test, a character rolls the skill Step (Rank+PER) against a Difficulty Number determined by the gamemaster. The gamemaster decides how well the character’s skill covers the subject of the Knowledge test, and determines whether the desired information is a well-known fact in that area of expertise or information known only to a few insiders. If the character is looking for a fact, the gamemaster’s decision results in a Difficulty Number and a Success Level to be achieved. This can be re-interpreted into a new Difficulty Number, which will sometimes be the case in various Earthdawn products. For example, if a Botany (7) test requires three successes because the information is not well-known even among botanists, a Botany (17) test might be asked for instead (a 17 scores three successes against a Difficulty Number of 7). If the character tries to learn as much as possible about a subject, the Difficulty Number is determined the same way, but no specific Success Level is required. Instead, every success gives the character additional information.</p>\n<p>Earthdawn products will often suggest a number of Knowledge skills and associated Difficulty Numbers along with a table showing what a character achieving different successes learns.</p>\n<p>For example, if a character tries to remember all sausages important to Throal cuisine, a Throal Cuisine (5) or a Barsaivian Cuisine (9) Test might be called for. One success with either skill would allow the character to learn the five most important Throalic sausages, while two successes would allow him to learn both the five most important, plus another four less important sausages, and so on. Although the skills and Difficulty Numbers differ, the knowledge gained would be the same if identical Success Levels were achieved.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge Relation</h3>\n<p>Before making a Knowledge test, the gamemaster determines how related the Knowledge skill and the subject at hand are. The relation of skill and knowledge determines the base Difficulty Number of the Knowledge test, as shown on the Knowledge Test Table. There are five broad categories for the relation a Knowledge skill has to a subject:</p>\n<p><em>To-the-Point</em> skills match the knowledge sought after exactly and are often very specialized Knowledge skills. For example, the Current Throal Politics Knowledge skill is the skill known to a character who keeps up-to-date on the day to day politics of Throal to the very detail, and the ideal source to learn about the change in Throalic politics brought about by King Neden’s death. </p>\n<p><em>Closely Related</em> skills cover the knowledge sought very closely, either by covering a slightly larger focus or a strongly related field of expertise. For example, the Throal Politics Knowledge skill is still a good source of knowledge about the aftermath of Neden’s death.</p>\n<p><em>Related</em> skills are the most common Knowledge skill found and cover a wider area of expertise, but the skill and knowledge sought are still quite related. For example, both the Barsaive Politics and Throal History skills would allow some access to knowledge about the Kingdom’s succession and policies.</p>\n<p><em>Hardly Related</em> skills might contain bits of relevant information where the desired knowledge is concerned. For example, the Throal Military Knowledge skill might cover some of the knowledge connected to Neden’s succession, as he served time in Throal’s military.</p>\n<p><em>Unrelated</em> skills cannot be used to learn anything about a given subject. For example, the Theran Cuisine Knowledge skill does not allow one to learn any facts about King Neden at all, even if he liked Theran food. They do not allow any Knowledge Tests to be made.</p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align:center\">Knowledge Test Table</h5>\n<table style=\"width:99.577%;height:108px\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:28px;background-color:#95a5a6\">\n<td style=\"width:48.5692%;height:28px\">Type of Information</td>\n<td style=\"width:51.0197%;height:28px\">\n<p>Difficulty Number</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:48.5692%;height:16px\">To-the-Point</td>\n<td style=\"width:51.0197%;height:16px\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:48.5692%;height:16px\">Closely Related</td>\n<td style=\"width:51.0197%;height:16px\">7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:48.5692%;height:16px\">Related</td>\n<td style=\"width:51.0197%;height:16px\">9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:48.5692%;height:16px\">Hardly Related</td>\n<td style=\"width:51.0197%;height:16px\">12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:48.5692%;height:16px\">Unrelated</td>\n<td style=\"width:51.0197%;height:16px\">NA</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Knowledge Obscurity</h3>\n<p>Once the relation of Knowledge skill and the field of expertise the knowledge is part of are determined, the gamemaster decides how successful the Knowledge test has to be to learn a specific fact or to what extent a character’s Knowledge test result covers it. The more obscure a piece of knowledge, the higher Success Level it requires. General information requires a single success. For example, the approximate date and rough circumstances of Kovar’s ascension are General information within the subjects of Kovar’s person, Throal politics, or Throal in general. Detailed information requires two successes. For example, Kovar’s accurate age and the day he ascended to the throne are Detailed information. Intricate information requires three successes. The stances that Throal’s noble houses took towards the succession and their immediate reactions and displays during the coronation ceremony are Intricate information. Obscure information requires at least four successes. Obscure information is typically secret knowledge, available only to an insider. The details of how Dollas reacted to news of Neden’s death is only known to members of the former royal family and close friends, and is obscure information.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge Skill Limits</h3>\n<p>Knowledge skills give your character facts, not abilities—they do not allow your character to perform a task. For example, knowledge of art does not make your character a painter; your character may know everything about every ship ever built and remain unable to sail one out of harbor. Knowledge skills let you determine what your character might want to do next; they do not necessarily enable your character to put a plan into action.</p>\n<p>A character successfully using a Knowledge skill knows information that applies to his current situation. The gamemaster gives the information to the player, allowing the character to act knowledgeably. If the gamemaster considers the information the character is looking for unimportant to the adventure, using a Knowledge skill will likely provide little information. Quite simply, players cannot expect the gamemaster to know or create every possible fact about the world of Earthdawn, nor every bit of knowledge they have to help them out in each and every circumstance.</p>"},"_id":"osAno1wWjVxVRjn1","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747833696,"modifiedTime":1671747853581,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"Gi2zZbdG8lrOAjHG","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Combat","color":"#7d059e"}},"pages":[{"name":"11. Mounted Combat","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h4>Mounted Combat</h4>\n<p>Mounted combat is common in the world of Earthdawn. Tribes of nomads and ork scorchers roam the plains of Barsaive, and magic has forged a whole Discipline dedicated to fighting while mounted, the Cavalryman. This section explains special rules that apply to mounted combat. There are abilities that alleviate the disadvantages or improve the advantages of fighting from a mount, most of them found in the Cavalryman Discipline. In this section a mounted character is referred to as a rider, and the animal that has a rider as a mount.</p>\n<p><strong>Mount Training</strong></p>\n<p>The amount of training a mount has determines how easy it is for the rider to handle it during combat or daily travels. Untrained mounts are not used to carrying Namegivers on their backs, and are often wild. They can hardly be ridden and spook away from combat, but some abilities such as Dominate Beast or Tame Mount allow a rider to control them quickly. Trained mounts are the type usually sold and allow riders. Their main purpose is for travel, as combat will frequently spook them. Combat mounts are accustomed to the sounds of the battlefield, trained to ride into or straight at other creatures on the rider’s command, and may even attack them. They are usually more expensive than trained mounts.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting And Staying Mounted</strong></p>\n<p>Mounting an animal takes a Standard action and requires the animal to be a trained mount. An untrained mount requires the character to make a Trick Riding test against the mount’s Social Defense. Dismounting is a Simple action. A rider may jump off his mount to attack in close combat; or he may throw himself off his mount to grapple a target. If grappling a target this way, the rider suffers Step 5/ D8 damage from the impact of the fall. If the grappling attempt is successful, the target also suffers Step 5/d8 damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Mounted Knockdown Tests</strong></p>\n<p>If the mount fails a Knockdown test, the rider is automatically knocked down as he falls off his mount. This fall and any other event that knocks a rider off his mount cause Step 5/D8 damage (an exception applies when using flying mounts, see Aerial Combat). If only the rider fails a Knockdown test, he falls off his mount, but the mount is unaffected. The gamemaster may disallow a rider the use of some abilities that enhance Knockdown tests, such as those that bind the character to solid earth or another object. Other abilities like the Sure Mount talent provide enhanced knockdown tests specifically for the purpose of staying mounted.</p>\n<p><strong>Mounted Combat Sequence</strong></p>\n<p>The combat sequence for mounted characters is the same as the normal @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.CqPKhNuMY200mDlo]{Combat Sequence}, but some special rules apply. The rider and his mount each have their own actions. If trained, the mount acts on the rider’s Initiative. Untrained mounts act on their own Initiative, which makes combat difficult at best, impossible at worst, as the mount moves and acts independently from the rider.</p>\n<p>A trained mount that did not have a rider at the beginning of the round changes its Initiative to that of the rider once mounted, but cannot take actions it has already used (in most cases, its standard action and movement).</p>\n<p><strong>Mounted Movement</strong></p>\n<p>For the purpose of movement, a rider and his mount are treated as one character as long as the rider controls the mount. While mounted, a mount’s Movement Rate is used instead of the rider’s. A character cannot use his own movement in a round in which he uses the mount’s movement, even if he dismounts; it is assumed he has already moved—investing the effort normally put into his own movement into directing the mount.</p>\n<p>Additionally, characters not familiar with their mounts must succeed at a Trick Riding test against the mount’s Social Defense to take their mounts into (but not away from) combat; Cavalrymen and Beastmasters are assumed to be familiar with their mounts at all times.</p>\n<p><strong>Running and Splitting Movement</strong></p>\n<p>A rider can instruct his mount to use its @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.YlJzZ4afr5ggqdqz]{Standard Action} to move. Doing this does not use the character’s Standard action. When using the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.0HbEVYqjIzZ40xAH]{Splitting Movement} combat option, the rider takes the Strain and is affected by the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.RfVAvUWYp3Wn4vk1]{Harried} modifier, not the mount.</p>\n<p>In many instances of mounted combat (see Charging Attacks below), both of these combat options will be used. Some abilities of the Cavalryman Discipline @Compendium[ed4pgpl.disciplin.LdsYxpIqibHgD8al]{Cavalryman} serve to alleviate these conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>Charging Attacks</strong></p>\n<p>Charging attacks allow a mounted character to use the momentum of the mount’s movement to deliver devastating blows. A charging attack requires a combat-trained mount or a successful Trick Riding test against the mount’s Social Defense.</p>\n<p>To make a charging attack, the rider must move towards the target in a relatively straight line at a rate higher than the mount’s Movement Rate (using the mount’s standard action to move). If the rider plans to move after the attack, by using the splitting movement combat option, it also has to be in a relatively straight line.</p>\n<p>A successful attack during a charging attack adds the mount’s Strength Step to the Damage Step due to the high momentum of the impact. If two riders make Charging Attacks against each other, they add the Strength Steps of both their mounts to the Damage Step, not just the Strength Step of their own mount. The high momentum can cause the rider to be thrown off his mount or lose his weapon. After a successful charging attack, the rider makes a Strength test against the target’s Toughness Step. If the test fails, a rider using a spear or lance-type weapon is thrown from his mount, suffering Step 5/D8 of damage and becoming knocked down. A rider using a shorter melee weapon like a sword or mace loses his weapon. Unarmed riders suffer no ill effect. Some weapons are not suited for Charging Attacks and may shatter on impact (refer to the weapon descriptions, p. 406). If a weapon shatters, the rider is not knocked off his mount and retains only a fractured piece of his weapon.</p>\n<p>When splitting movement on a charging attack, the rider may not use additional attack abilities, such as the Second Attack, Second Weapon, or Momentum Attack talents or skills, as rider and mount move past the target too fast. Only when ending their movement next to a target can these abilities be used. There are several specialized talents that allow for additional attacks during a charge, however.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Handling Mounted Combat</h4>\n<p>Mounted Combat can seem difficult to handle during the game because of the requirements for a charging attack and the many combat options involved. This guide presents the typical procedures for different types of mounted attacks and suggests some terms for identifying them during a game in which mounted combat frequently occurs.</p>\n<p><strong>Stationary attacks</strong> do not involve movement. The rider simply attacks from his mount’s back, and the mount can also make attacks. Some talents, such as Down Strike or Wheeling Defense, enhance stationary Mounted Combat. There are no extra combat options or modifiers to consider.</p>\n<p><strong>Mobile attacks</strong> are those where the mount moves before or after the attack. They share a lot of traits with stationary attacks. There are no modifiers for the attacker, but the defender may have to delay or reserve his action to attack in close combat (if his Initiative is higher and he cannot move far enough on his turn to reach the mount, which often has a higher Movement Rate). If the defender’s Initiative is lower than the attacker’s and the attacker moves away after attacking, the defender often cannot attack in close combat. </p>\n<p><strong>Charging attacks</strong> require the mount to use its Standard action to move. It cannot attack and must move more than its Movement Rate towards the target. The rider’s damage is enhanced by the mount’s Strength Step (and possibly the Charge talent). The mount’s movement ends next to the target. A defender can Set Against a Charge to strike the attacker before being hit and may profit from the momentum if successful.</p>\n<p><strong>Ride-by attacks</strong> use the splitting movement combat option. The mount moves before and after the attack so the mount’s movement does not end next to the target. The mount may attack. Splitting movement causes the adept to be harried and take 1 Strain, although Cavalryman abilities can circumvent this. Damage is not increased as with a charging attack. The defender can delay or reserve actions as with a mobile attack.</p>\n<p><strong>All-out charging attacks</strong> use both splitting movement and the mount’s Standard action to allow for a charging attack that does not end next to the target. The mount moves more than its Movement Rate towards the target, and up to what remains of its doubled Movement Rate away. The mount cannot attack. Damage is enhanced as per charging attacks, and the rider takes 1 Strain and is harried, except where abilities circumvent this. The defender may set against the charge. The Wheeling Attack talent allows a character to circumvent the requirement to move before the attack, but the mount has to move the full distance during the round, usually after the attack.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Davon rides a mount with Movement Rate 15. He looks around for enemies he can target with a charging attack. His opponents are at distances of 14, 21, and 27 yards away. To make a charging attack, his mount must move at least 17 yards (more than its normal Movement Rate of 15), so two opponents are eligible for a charge, the ones 21 and 27 yards away. He chooses to attack the closer opponent, moves 21 yards to be adjacent to him, and his attack is successful. After the attack, he is directly adjacent to that opponent.</em></p>\n<p><em>He could have used the splitting movement combat option to move another 9 yards away from that opponent, which might have set him up for a charging attack against another enemy.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mounted Weapon Use</strong></p>\n<p>Mounted characters can use long weaponry like lances or spears differently from other characters due to their special posture and the ability to hook them to their armor, saddle, or brace them under their arms, allowing them to wield these weapons with one hand. This situation is only beneficial when there is enough room to maneuver or while charging. If the mount would not be able to move at least 2 yards (regardless of if it actually does), the rider receives the difference between the weapon’s size and his one-handed size limit as a penalty to all Attack and Damage tests with the weapon, as it becomes unwieldy in a close-quarters fight.</p>\n<p><strong>Mount Attacks</strong></p>\n<p>Combat-trained mounts may be directed by their rider to use their Standard action to make their own attacks, employing the Steps and abilities found in the creature’s description. Mounts not trained for combat may also make attacks, but these are not controlled by the rider, and the mount usually only attacks if threatened.</p>"},"_id":"Afzk2IvKczkiHIxy","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747833501,"modifiedTime":1671747853943,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"H9SepRjoJykVMFHR","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

There are other enemies, and I have no doubt the Therans are waiting for an opportunity to return.</p>\n<p>•Commander Sigrun Dalben, addressing his troops after the Battle of Sky Point •</p>\n<p>Davon woke to the smell of smoke and the sound of battle. He tossed aside his light linen blanket and rolled out of bed. He pulled on a pair of breeches, but didn’t bother with a shirt or boots—it was a warm night, and the soles of his feet were toughened by wanderings in the nearby woods.</p>\n<p>He was halfway down the ladder from his loft bedroom when he heard the front door crash open, and a quick, startled cry from his mother. Feeling a rush of anger, he leapt to the ground. His balance wavered, but he managed to keep his feet and ran for the opening between the kitchen and the cottage’s living area.</p>\n<p>Maura stood with her back to her son. In one hand she held the fireplace poker, pointing it towards the unfamiliar figure that loomed in the front door.</p>\n<p>Even in the dim light, Davon could tell the threatening figure was a troll. No trolls lived in Aspen Glen, but they occasionally traveled with the caravans that came to visit the village. He stood just over eight feet tall, and the horns that twisted up from his forehead added another nine or ten inches.</p>\n<p>The troll was dressed in leather and mail, a patchwork of pieces salvaged from fallen opponents. A coiled whip hung from his belt, and in one hand he held a sword that most people would need two hands to wield.</p>\n<p>The troll’s eyes met Davon’s from across the room, and the hard face shifted into a wicked smile. Dirty canines came into view, half masked by a shaggy black mustache and beard. Fear knotted Davon’s gut.</p>\n<p>Maura noticed the shift in the troll’s attention, and glanced over her shoulder to see her son. She seized the opportunity.</p>\n<p>Taking two quick steps, she grabbed a lantern from the side table, and threw it at the invader. Her aim was off, and the lantern shattered against the doorframe. The troll, caught off guard by the assault, growled something in a language Davon couldn’t understand, and turned his attention back to the woman.</p>\n<p>Maura said one word, “Ignace,” and the oil that had spattered the troll’s face and shoulder burst into flame. He roared in pain, dropped his sword, and began beating at the fire that engulfed his head. The smell of burning flesh filled the room.</p>\n<p>“Davon, get your sister!”</p>\n<p>His mother’s order broke Davon’s paralysis. He crossed the kitchen to the room his father had added the summer before his sister was born. He pushed open the door and waited for his eyes to adjust to the darkness.</p>\n<p>Anna was sitting up in bed, rubbing her eyes, her voice muffled with sleep.</p>\n<p>“Davon?”</p>\n<p>“We need to leave, Anna. Get up and get dressed, quickly.”</p>\n<p>For once, the girl listened to him. She got out of bed and began pulling on clothes.</p>\n<p>While she did, Davon opened the shutters to the room’s only window. Outside, several other buildings were on fire. Beyond lay the forest, dark and inviting. If they could reach the line of trees, they would be safe until the attack was over.</p>\n<p>There was a crash from the other room, and a scream from Maura—Davon couldn’t tell whether it was in pain or anger. Hearing her mother’s scream brought Anna out of her groggy half-sleep. “What is happening to momma?” she asked. Davon didn’t answer. He didn’t want to think about what might be happening a dozen feet from where they stood. “Help me move the bed to the window.”</p>\n<p>The girl did her best, but Davon did most of the work. When the bed was in place, Davon boosted himself up, his lanky frame slipping through the window. The mossy ground behind the cottage absorbed his landing, and in moments he was on his feet, helping Anna through the window.</p>\n<p>“Come now,” urged Davon. “Quietly. We are going to hide in the forest until it’s safe to come back.”</p>\n<p>“What about momma?”</p>\n<p>“She will be along soon. Don’t worry.” Despite his own fear, Davon managed to sound reassuring. Anna took his hand, and they made their way towards the forest. They crossed half the distance to the tree line, the sounds of fighting fading behind them. Their escape appeared to have gone unnoticed, and Davon’s hopes began to lift. A crash sounded from the woodcutter’s shed just ahead of them. Davon and Anna froze as a large human emerged from the shed. He was dressed like the troll in the cottage—leather and mail, a broadsword at his side. His head was shaved, and dec- orated with elaborate tattoos. In one hand he held a sack, in the other a torch. The raider turned and set the thatch roof on fire. He watched the flames spread, his back towards the pair.</p>\n<p>Davon thought about making a break for the trees when the raider turned, and saw the children in the light of the blooming fire. The human dropped the sack, and drew his sword. He spoke in that unfamiliar language, and laughed. Davon pushed Anna behind him, placing himself between the raider and his sister.</p>\n<p>Seeing Davon take a defensive stance, the raider laughed again. Davon didn’t like the tone of the laugh—it promised pain, and the raider looked all too willing to deliver on that promise.</p>\n<p>The raider called out, and his call was answered with raised voices from the di- rection of the village green. Davon looked back over his shoulder and saw two more raiders come around the side of a nearby building.</p>\n<p>Despite the warm night, Davon felt a chill. They could have lost the raiders in the darkness of the woods, but the human had cut off that avenue of escape.</p>\n<p>Anna clutched at Davon, peeking out at the tattooed warrior from behind his leg. Davon could feel her trembling in fear.</p>\n<p>Davon looked down at his sister, doing his best to keep his voice steady. “Anna, do you remember the way to the fairy spring?”</p>\n<p>The girl nodded.</p>\n<p>“Then when I tell you, run into the forest, and tell the fairy to help hide you.”</p>\n<p>Davon hoped the elemental spirit of the spring would be up to the task. “Don’t look back. I will be right behind you.”</p>\n<p>His sister’s eyes began to fill with tears. “No crying now. Momma will find us as soon as it’s safe.” The girl nodded again, her face screwed up with the childish deter- mination not to cry.</p>\n<p>Davon gave his sister a gentle pat on the head. “Be brave. Run as fast as you can and do not look back.” Before he could talk himself out of it, he pushed his sister to one side and ran towards the tattooed raider, screaming, “Now, Anna! Run!”</p>\n<p>The raider expected the charge. He stepped to one side, stuck his leg out, and Davon sprawled to the ground. In the same movement, the raider extended his arm and caught Anna around the waist, scooping the girl up under his sword arm. Wind knocked out of him, Davon’s heart sank as he watched the tattooed raider carry his sister back towards the village. The other two raiders continued approach- ing, weapons drawn.</p>\n<p>The one on the left was another human, short and stocky, wearing a heavy leather doublet studded with rivets. His light brown hair was tied back in a braid, and his left eye was covered with a patch. He held a small axe in his hand. Another axe hung from a loop at his belt. Both blades were stained dark with blood.</p>\n<p>The one on the right was an ork, burly and bare-armed. His cropped black hair stuck out from his head in random directions. He wore a dirty wolf skin, and his chipped tusks stuck out over his upper lip. He held a curved sword in his hand, and a broad bladed dagger hung from his belt.</p>\n<p>Davon had one chance. He staggered to his feet, acting more dazed than he felt. He watched the way the raiders relaxed, confident the boy posed no threat.</p>\n<p>When the raiders were two paces away, he launched himself at Wolfskin with a roar. One hand grabbed the ork’s wrist, keeping the raider from bringing his weapon to bear. The other grabbed at the dagger and pulled it free.</p>\n<p>Davon’s momentum sent the pair tumbling to the ground. With all his strength, Davon plunged the dagger into the ork’s belly.</p>\n<p>Davon barely registered the blood flowing over his hand. He rolled away from Wolfskin, jabbing the wound with his elbow. The ork bellowed in pain clutched at the wound.</p>\n<p>Eyepatch growled and stepped forward, swinging his axe. Davon saw the weapon coming for him and tried to get out of the way.</p>\n<p>He almost succeeded. The blow sliced open his left shoulder. Davon cried out in pain and dropped the dagger.</p>\n<p>Eyepatch kicked Davon in the stomach, knocking the wind out of him. Davon curled into a ball as the raider continued to kick him. The wound on his shoulder stung in the open air, and the blood smeared across his arm and back picked up dirt and debris from the ground.</p>\n<p>Wolfskin got to his feet and staggered over, retrieving his sword and dagger. He said something to Eyepatch, and the raider stopped kicking. The two began talking to each other, the ork’s tone indicating that he was planning some kind of painful revenge on the youth.</p>\n<p>Davon started to crawl away, hoping that the two were distracted enough to allow him to escape. His shoulder burned, and he found it hard to breathe. He had made it perhaps a dozen feet when he felt a meaty hand close on his ankle.</p>\n<p>His hopes of escape dashed, Davon whispered a prayer to Garlen, asking her to watch over his sister.</p>\n<p>Before the death blow could land, a voice called out from the center of the village. Wolfskin knelt and grabbed Davon by the hair, lifting his head off the ground and star- ing the boy in the eye. He snarled a few words, his breath making Davon’s eyes water. Whatever curse or warning he gave Davon drew a laugh from Eyepatch. Wolfskin let go of Davon’s hair, and the boy’s head thumped into the ground. As the two raiders turned to go, Davon found the strength for one last act of defiance. He raised himself to his elbows, his vision swimming. He called, “If I meet you again, I will kill you.” Wolfskin turned, grunted, and kicked Davon squarely in the jaw. Davon’s head snapped back, and he slumped to the ground, unconsciousness dulling the pain.</p>\n<p>•••</p>\n<p>Errig Quicklance, commander of the Falcon detachment of Terath’s Chargers, sur- veyed the ruined village below. She was tall, and despite her age sat straight in the saddle.</p>\n<p>She wore her traveling armor: a hardened-leather tunic and greaves, decorated with abstract patterns that suggested a bird of prey in flight. Her gray hair was knot- ted back in a braid reaching to the middle of her back.</p>\n<p>A handful of survivors moved around the remains of the village, doing what they could to gather the pieces of their shattered lives. Errig heard the jingle of harness and the rustle of two score ork cavalry waiting for her orders.</p>\n<p>Her scouts had spotted the smoke at dawn, and the detachment had ridden hard to reach the battle site. It was the fourth village they had come across in the past week, each one telling much the same story.</p>\n<p>Errig turned Autumn Thunder, her chestnut mare, and rode back down the hill. Hrogar Blacktusk, her lieutenant, waited on his black stallion, Midnight Justice. Hrog- ar wore a sleeveless tunic under a green leather cuirass and brown leggings. His bare arms were decorated with a series of tattoos; a tally of the opponents he had defeated in battle.</p>\n<p>Errig raised her voice and addressed the troops. “Dismount and take a few min- utes rest, but be ready to move again at a moment’s notice.” She turned to her lieu- tenant. “Hrogar, come with me.”</p>\n<p>The two orks cantered over the hill and down toward the village. The villagers eyed them warily. Based on the condition of the village, Errig thought it may have been hit as recently as last night. The Falcons were gaining on the raiders.</p>\n<p>Errig and Hrogar brought their mounts to a halt a dozen yards outside the edge of the village. Errig stood in the stirrups and called out in the dwarven trading tongue “I would speak with the one in charge here.”</p>\n<p>One of the villagers, an elf dressed in a simple tunic and breeches, stepped for- ward. Errig could not tell how old he was. The years did not weigh on an elf’s face the same way they did on the other Name-giver races. Her mother had said it was because the elves lived without passion, distancing themselves from the truth of life. Errig wasn’t sure either way, but she could not deny that elves often seemed cold, distant, and without emotion.</p>\n<p>She raised a hand, palm out, in greeting. “I am Errig Quicklance of Terath’s Char- gers. My detachment has been following a band of raiders for several days. It seems we are on the right track.”</p>\n<p>The elf nodded and replied in a clear, strong voice. “Greetings, Errig Quicklance. I am Beras, Songsmith of Aspen Glen. You are right on their heels. We were attacked last night, and many of our kin lie dead. Others were taken from us by these raiders, I fear to be sold as slaves.”</p>\n<p>Hrogar swore in orkish, and spat to his right.</p>\n<p>“I am sorry for your loss,” said Errig. “If you would accept our aid, we have some in our troop skilled at tending battle wounds, and strong arms and backs to help you with other tasks.”</p>\n<p>Beras smiled and bowed. “Thank you for your offer. Our healer was one of those lost to Death’s embrace.”</p>\n<p>Errig turned to Hrogar. “Ride back and organize a squad of volunteers to come down and help these folk. Tell Gaya and Turbaz to come as well to tend the wounded.” Hrogar scowled. “Why are we stopping to aid these ujnort? If we ride hard, we may catch up with those jackals. Let these farmers tend their own, and let us ride to glory!”</p>\n<p>“Hrogar, I know your gahad burns to bring these bandits to justice. My own soul cries out for vengeance as well. For now, we honor Garlen. Thystonius and Lochost will get their due in time.”</p>\n<p>Hrogar was silent, the emotional struggle plain on his face.</p>\n<p>“After you have done this, take a squad and patrol the perimeter. Let’s make sure we have no surprises while we’re here.”</p>\n<p>Hrogar nodded and spurred Midnight Justice into a gallop that quickly took him out of sight beyond the crest of the hill.</p>\n<p>Beras watched him go, and then turned his attention back to Errig. “He did not seem very happy about that.”</p>\n<p>Errig let the statement pass without comment. Hrogar was young and eager, but he was a long way from being an effective commander.</p>\n<p>Errig dismounted. “I would like to speak with your people about the attack. The more we know about these raiders, their numbers, and their tactics, the more effec- tive our strike will be.”</p>\n<p>“Of course. If you will come with me, I will make arrangements for you and your men.”</p>\n<p>•••</p>\n<p>The Falcons spent about three hours at Aspen Glen. The raiders headed west af- ter the attack, towards the northern foothills of the Tylon Mountains. Based on the tracks, their wagons were heavily loaded. Errig guessed the raiders would meet their contact soon and unload their cargo. She hoped her troops would catch them before the captives were sold.</p>\n<p>They had learned some useful information from the villagers. The raiders were reasonably well equipped, but the way the attack was described, they lacked disci- pline. They used the element of surprise and the confusion that caused to their advan- tage. In open battle against an experienced force—or if they were ambushed them- selves—they would be easily defeated.</p>\n<p>Errig gave the order for the Falcons to mount up and make ready to leave. As the orders were carried out, Beras extended his arm.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your aid, Commander Quicklance. When you have run these raid- ers down, please return as our guest and tell us the tale of your battle.”</p>\n<p>Errig grasped his forearm. “It would be an honor, Songsmith.” She mounted Autumn Thunder, and addressed the gathered villagers. “I swear we will do all we can to bring your kin back to you.”</p>\n<p>Beras raised his hand in benediction. “Floranuus grant you speed!”</p>\n<p>Errig turned Autumn Thunder west and spurred her into a gallop. She met up with the Falcons, and slowed her mare’s pace to a trot. Hrogar rode alongside.</p>\n<p>They had gone barely two hundred yards when a figure stepped out of the trees, directly into their path. Errig turned Autumn Thunder aside and waved the column to a halt. Hrogar was caught more unaware, and he jerked hard on the reins to keep from trampling the sudden obstacle. Midnight Justice reared and pawed the air.</p>\n<p>The newcomer was young elf dressed in simple tunic and trousers, a little bit too large for his lean frame. His tousled hair was light brown, and his left arm was in a sling. He looked perhaps twelve or thirteen summers in age—though given how slow- ly elves matured, he might be as old as fifteen or sixteen.</p>\n<p>“Take me with you.” The boy’s voice was quiet, but firm.</p>\n<p>Hrogar sighed. “We ride to battle, farm boy, not a picnic.”</p>\n<p>“Take me with you.”</p>\n<p>Hrogar tried to walk his stallion around the boy, but the youth moved to bar the ork’s way.</p>\n<p>“Take me with you.”</p>\n<p>Hrogar snarled in frustration. He dismounted, and moved toward the elf. He placed his hands on the boy’s shoulders, intending to move him aside. When he did so, the boy placed his right hand on Hrogar’s sword hilt, his left foot on the ork’s thigh, and kicked away.</p>\n<p>The blade came ringing free, and Hrogar found himself staring down three feet of steel. He took a cautious step back, and glanced at his commander, surprise and anger on his face.</p>\n<p>“Take me with you.”</p>\n<p>Errig looked the boy over. He had the lanky grace of a year-old colt, all limbs and angles. Despite his injury the sword stayed level, though the effort involved was clear. There was a fire in this boy, and Errig did not think there was anything she could do to sway him from his chosen course.</p>\n<p>“Can you ride, boy?”</p>\n<p>The elf looked at her, and nodded. The point of the sword dipped towards the ground.</p>\n<p>“Then you can come,” said Errig. She called back over her shoulder, “Bring up one of the spare mounts.”</p>\n<p>The boy stuck the sword into the ground and walked toward Errig. He looked the ork in the eye and said, “Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Hrogar looked like he was about to say something, but a glance from his commander stopped him. He stepped forward and pulled his sword out of the ground. Brushing the dirt off with his hand, he stalked back towards Midnight Justice. He mounted the stallion and waited for the boy’s horse to be brought forward. One of the Falcons brought forward a dun-colored mare, saddled and bridled. He passed the reins to Errig, who handed them to the boy.</p>\n<p>“This is Winter Cloud. She will carry you well.”</p>\n<p>The boy stood for a few moments, scratching Winter Cloud’s nose and letting her get used to his scent. He clearly had some experience with horses. The mare bore the treatment stoically. She was one of the detachment’s older horses, more relaxed than most of the other mounts the Falcons rode.</p>\n<p>After a few moments of getting acquainted, the elf mounted. He had some difficul- ty because of his injury, but he managed to get astride Winter Cloud and settled into the saddle. Errig couldn’t resist the urge to smile. The elf boy seemed small and frail in the cavalry saddle, which was sized for an ork warrior.</p>\n<p>Hrogar watched all of this with a dark expression, clearly unhappy that the boy had embarrassed him, and that he would be riding with them. “A dalliance or two with a plow horse does not make you a rider, farm boy,” he said.</p>\n<p>“My name is Davon,” the elf replied.</p>\n<p>“You will not be with us long enough for it to matter.”</p>\n<p>“Enough, Hrogar,” said Errig. She turned to Davon. “We will not slow our pace for you, so you had better keep up.”</p>\n<p>The elf nodded.</p>\n<p>“All right then,” said Errig. She looked back at the Falcons. “Daylight is wasting,”</p>\n<p>she bellowed. “Let us ride!”</p>\n<p>The Falcons spurred their horses to a gallop, swerving around Davon, who sat looking back toward Aspen Glen. After a moment, he turned Winter Cloud to the west and urged her to follow.</p>\n<p>•••</p>\n<p>Later that day, when the cavalry stopped for a break, one of the ork riders came over to Davon and examined his wound.</p>\n<p>“Not bad work, but this isn’t the sort of thing you want to carry into battle.” He grinned and added, “Wear with pride afterwards, perhaps.” The ork smeared some foul-smelling paste on the wound, which grew warm and began to itch madly. After a few minutes, the itching faded and Davon found the pain was nearly gone.</p>\n<p>“A gift from Garlen,” the ork said. “Magic.”</p>\n<p>As the troop of riders followed the trail left by the slave wagons, other orks came up to Davon. One offered a stiff leather jerkin, which Davon pulled over his head and tightened as best he could. Another brought a short sword, plain but serviceable. In general, the Falcons were friendly and open with Davon. Apparently, his insistence on joining them had impressed them, and they did the best they could to equip him for the coming battle.</p>\n<p>Only the one called Hrogar was distant. Davon caught the ork glaring at him from time to time. Davon tried not to let it bother him—he had embarrassed the ork, and clearly the temperamental lieutenant held it against him.</p>\n<p>The forward scouts found the slave camp just before nightfall. There were four wagons, and about thirty or forty armed guards. Errig decided to let the slavers get comfortable and complacent, planning their strike for shortly after midnight.</p>\n<p>Davon found combat was a loud, bloody, terrifying mess. He felt the horse move under him, the thunder of hooves rang in his ears. Errig had been right, though; Win- ter Cloud carried him well. Davon did not guide the mare so much as cling to her back, wildly swinging his sword and hoping he did not die.</p>\n<p>If he died, nobody would be left to take care of his sister.</p>\n<p>A figure appeared out of the dark, silhouetted against one of the fires. Davon rec- ognized the outline of Eyepatch, and his fear was washed away in a rush of anger. He turned Winter Cloud toward the raider, and kicked her flanks, urging her into a gallop. The mare’s hooves tore up the ground as she sped toward the human. Davon crouched low over her neck, and his grip on the sword tightened. The raider filled his field of vision.</p>\n<p>Eyepatch’s eye met Davon’s, widened briefly, then narrowed. His upper lip curled in a sneer. He faced Davon squarely, sword at the ready, his back to the fire. The sounds of battle faded. Everything focused down to a few details: the blood pulsing in his ears, the sword’s leather grip against his palm, the surge of Winter Cloud’s muscles beneath him.</p>\n<p>Something opened inside Davon. Winter Cloud’s movements became his own. The two beings, for an instant, became one. Davon’s hooves tore up the turf as horse and rider bore down on their target, two hearts beating with singular purpose. The unity passed as quickly as it had come, though Davon did not have time to dwell on it. He launched himself into the air, arms outstretched, sword in hand. Winter Cloud adjusted her course, skirting the edge of the fire and kicking at the other raiders who had taken up defensive positions around the flames.</p>\n<p>Davon struck the raider, his momentum knocking the pair backwards into the fire. The smell of burning hair filled Davon’s nose. Fortunately, Eyepatch’s body shield- ed Davon from the direct fury of the flames.</p>\n<p>Eyepatch roared, wrapped his arms around Davon, and tried to roll over. Davon couldn’t bring his blade to bear, and punched the human twice in the face with the pommel.</p>\n<p>The raider cried out, and his grip loosened. The boy took that opportunity to push himself upright, knees on Eyepatch’s belt. Reversing his grip on the sword, he drove it downward into the human’s chest, putting all his weight behind it.</p>\n<p>The blade pierced the leather armor, but met resistance just below the flesh. Davon shifted his weight, changing the angle of his thrust. The point of the blade slipped off the rib and sunk into the raider’s chest.</p>\n<p>His lung pierced, Eyepatch’s bellow became a gurgling hiss. His eye widened in shock, and he pawed at Davon, grasping for whatever handhold he could as he slipped into Death’s domain.</p>\n<p>Davon backed out of the human’s reach, pulling his sword free. The raider was no longer a concern, but there were other enemies nearby.</p>\n<p>He looked around, and saw that Winter Cloud had been fighting a battle of her own, kicking at the nearby raiders, taking the fight out of them and leaving many with broken arms or legs.</p>\n<p>Davon spotted one of the slave wagons, and ran towards it, calling Anna’s name. Halfway there, a dwarf in a chain shirt and wielding a large hammer closed to attack, swinging the hammer in a wide arc.</p>\n<p>Davon did his best to keep his sword pointed at the enemy, but the dwarf kept knocking it aside. Davon was forced to retreat, moving away from the wagons. Davon became desperate, looking for some advantage.</p>\n<p>Before he could find one, he tripped over the arm of a dead raider. Davon landed hard, and the sword fell from his hand. The dwarf grinned, revealing a lone gold tooth in the midst of several dirty and broken ones.</p>\n<p>Davon’s sword lay just within reach. He extended his arm, and his fingers wrapped around the hilt. Before he could lift the weapon, the dwarf stomped on Davon’s hand. Davon felt the bones crack, and cried out in pain.</p>\n<p>The dwarf’s grin widened, and he shifted his weight, putting more pressure on Davon’s wounded hand. Davon tried to pull free, but his hand was trapped. The dwarf swung his hammer back, readying it for an overhand smash. For the second time in twenty-four hours, Davon looked Death in the eyes.</p>\n<p>Before it could take him, Winter Cloud galloped up and reared, striking at the dwarf with her front hooves. The dwarf, unprepared for the attack, was knocked off balance. He fell back, and Winter Cloud brought her full weight down on the raider’s head. The dwarf twitched, then lay still.</p>\n<p>Winter Cloud stomped on the dwarf a couple more times, then looked back at Davon. The boy struggled to his feet, cradling his wounded hand against his chest. He walked over to the horse, scratched her chin with his good hand, and laid his cheek against hers.</p>\n<p>“Thank you,” he said. “You are a noble beast.”</p>\n<p>Winter Cloud snorted in reply, and gently nudged him with her head.</p>\n<p>The immediate danger past, Davon started back toward the slave wagon. Winter Cloud walked alongside. The battle was nearly over—a few raiders still fought, but the more disciplined ork cavalry was making quick work of them.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, Davon didn’t encounter any more obstacles on the way to the wagons. His sword lay somewhere behind him. Even if he still had it, his wounded hand would make it difficult to use.</p>\n<p>Davon’s eyes adjusted to the darkness at the edge of the raider camp, and the hope that had been building vanished.</p>\n<p>The cages were empty.</p>\n<p>•••</p>\n<p>The sun was climbing the eastern sky, and the dew glittered like gems on a jew- eler’s cloth. Errig sat on a flat stone, eating porridge out of a wooden bowl. Autumn Thunder grazed nearby.</p>\n<p>Hrogar approached, leading Midnight Justice. “The prisoners are being branded as ordered.”</p>\n<p>Errig nodded. “When that is done, set them loose and get the troops ready to ride. I want to be back at the main camp as soon as possible.”</p>\n<p>Hrogar nodded and turned to go. He stopped and swore. Errig looked up and saw Davon coming up the hill.</p>\n<p>“When do we go after the slaves?” he asked.</p>\n<p>Hrogar rolled his eyes. “We don’t.”</p>\n<p>“But we have to go after them!”</p>\n<p>Hrogar stepped forward and crossed his arms over his chest. “No, farm boy. We don’t. They were loaded onto an airship—no doubt bound for a slave market somewhere. Even if we knew where it was, they would be sold and shipped Passions know where long before we got there.”</p>\n<p>Davon glared at Hrogar. Hrogar returned the expression. Davon shifted his gaze to Errig. “You gave your word.”</p>\n<p>Errig shook her head. “I said I would do all I could. Our orders were to deal with the raiders. We have done that. I’m sorry we didn’t catch up with them before they sold off their captives.”</p>\n<p>The muscles in Davon’s jaw flexed as he ground his teeth. His fists clenched, and Hrogar tensed, expecting an assault. Errig watched the pair, impressed at the boy’s spirit.</p>\n<p>Davon gave a frustrated sigh, then turned and stormed away.</p>\n<p>“He’s going to get himself killed,” said Hrogar.</p>\n<p>“Maybe.” Errig watched Davon walk down the hill, where Winter Cloud stood waiting. The boy stopped when he reached the horse and absently scratched her shoulder. He glanced back toward Errig and Hrogar, and when he saw them watching, turned and started walking again. Winter Cloud followed close behind.</p>\n<p>Errig looked over at Autumn Thunder. The mare sensed her gaze and looked up from grazing. She walked over and lipped Errig’s ear. Errig smiled, and scratched Au- tumn Thunder’s chin. “Maybe not,” she murmured.</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry?” asked Hrogar.</p>\n<p>“Nothing.” Errig finished her breakfast. “See to the prisoners, and get the troops ready to ride.”</p>\n<p>Hrogar saluted. “Yes, sir.” He turned and led Midnight Justice down the hill toward the camp.</p>\n<p>Errig watched him go, and then looked for Davon. The boy had not gone far—he stood on the crest of another hill, looking off to the south.</p>\n<p>Errig rubbed Autumn Thunder’s shoulder. “Come on, girl. Let’s have a talk with the lad.”</p>\n<p>The mare followed. Davon heard them approaching, looked back over his shoul- der, then turned away. Errig stopped and stood quietly beside him. After a minute, Errig broke the silence. “It’s hard, fighting for those you love and feeling like you’ve failed them.”</p>\n<p>Davon glanced at Errig, his eyes narrow and his mouth set in a thin line. Errig ignored the look and continued. “You didn’t fail them. You may not have rescued them, but you struck back at their captors, and fought well. That is something to be proud of.”</p>\n<p>Davon scuffed his foot in the dirt. “There is nothing left for me back home. My mother is dead, and my sister is on that airship.”</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry,” said Errig.</p>\n<p>Silence fell between them. Errig watched Davon. The boy’s gaze didn’t rest in one place for long, and he kept fidgeting. Once or twice he looked like he was about to speak, but he kept silent.</p>\n<p>After a few minutes, Errig spoke. “There is something else on your mind, lad— something more than the loss of your mother and sister.”</p>\n<p>Davon took a deep breath and steadied himself. “During the fight, I saw the raider I fought back home. I went after him… and something happened.” He paused, and bit his lower lip.</p>\n<p>“For a moment, as I charged to attack… I’m not sure how to describe it.”</p>\n<p>“Take your time, lad. There is no rush.”</p>\n<p>“It was strange. I was riding Winter Cloud, but I also was Winter Cloud, being ridden. Her hooves were tearing up the ground, but they were my hooves. It was like she could read my thoughts—she would turn without a pull on the reins. We were one mind. One body. It was...”</p>\n<p>“Magical?” said Errig.</p>\n<p>“Yes.” Davon’s eyes were wide. “How did you...?”</p>\n<p>Errig laughed. “I’m an adept! A Cavalryman. All of the Falcons have felt that one- ness at one time or another, and many of us draw power from the special bond be- tween horse and rider. What you felt last night was a taste of that magic.”</p>\n<p>“Magic,” whispered Davon. He was silent for a few moments. “My mother said I didn’t have the aptitude for magic.”</p>\n<p>“She knows magic, does she?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. She is...” a pained look passed over Davon’s face. “She was an Elementalist.” He looked down, face red.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” said Errig, looking into the distance to give the boy a moment to deal with his grief.</p>\n<p>After a moment, she continued. “I don’t know much about Elementalists, but I know horses.” He nodded towards Winter Cloud. “She is telling me you are a rider born.”</p>\n<p>“Really? You can talk to her?”</p>\n<p>“Not exactly, no.” Errig chuckled. “But she tells me just the same.” She saw Davon’s puzzled expression and continued. “I read the body language—the same way you can tell if somebody is excited, or angry, or upset.”</p>\n<p>Davon nodded, and Errig continued. “She bonded to you last night. That’s why she has been following you around all morning.”</p>\n<p>Davon blushed, and the corner of his mouth turned up in the echo of a smile. “I was wondering about that.”</p>\n<p>Errig smiled. “It happens from time to time, but the effects fade after a day or two.” She saw Davon’s expression darken at the thought of the bond fading. This lad really is a rider born, she thought. I wonder.</p>\n<p>She looked over at Autumn Thunder. The mare looked up from her grazing with an expression that said, Why are you asking me? You’ve already made up your mind. She turned back to Davon. “We’ll have to find you another mount.”</p>\n<p>“But I am fine with Winter Cloud,” protested Davon.</p>\n<p>“I know,” said Errig. “But that is the effect of the magic from last night. Spending time with Winter Cloud will just make it more difficult to form a proper bond later.”</p>\n<p>“A proper bond? You mean…?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, lad. I am offering to take you with us and see that you are trained as a proper Cavalryman. I won’t lie to you—it will be hard work, and you will face more than a bit of trouble from the other recruits. But I think you have got potential, and it would give you the skills you need to go out there after other bands of slavers.”</p>\n<p>Davon stood with his mouth open.</p>\n<p>“I can read people as well as horses, lad,” said Errig. “So, do you accept?”</p>\n<p>Davon chewed his lower lip, his gaze moving from Errig, to Autumn Thunder, to Winter Cloud, and back to Errig again.</p>\n<p>For the first time since Errig had met him, Davon truly smiled. “I accept,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Wonderful,” said Errig. “Come along, Davon. Hrogar is waiting for us at the bottom of the hill—and not very patiently.”</p>\n<p>“He’s not going to be happy about this.”</p>\n<p>“Maybe not,” said Errig. “But I’ll handle it.” She handed Winter Cloud’s reins to the boy, and the pair started down the hill.</p>"},"_id":"G7HgZCOVsqEMbB0g","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747833852,"modifiedTime":1671747853374,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"HaN8AscJJMOkxZm8","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Spell Magic","color":"#ef0101"}},"pages":[{"name":"14. Spell Details","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>The following pages provide game information on the spells available to the different magician Disciplines. Each spell description includes the following information.</p>\n<h4>Threads</h4>\n<p>Threads indicates the number of spell threads that must be woven in order to cast the base version of the spell. Some spells are simple enough that a Standard Matrix can hold the full spell pattern, and do not require the caster to weave additional threads. These spells are indicated with a “0”. A magician still has the option to weave additional threads as described in the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.zzMT9RP7z6nATWnR]{Spellcasting sequence}.</p>\n<h4>Weaving</h4>\n<p>Weaving provides the Difficulty Numbers for Thread Weaving tests. There are two values given. The first is the Difficulty Number for weaving threads prior to casting the spell. The second value is the Reattuning Difficulty, used when a magician is attempting to reattune a spell on the fly (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.jdJyq1dp2Hwilxzw]{Casting from a Spell Matrix}).</p>\n<p>Even spells that do not require threads for the base version of the spell will have a weaving difficulty, to set the difficulty of weaving additional threads to enhance the spell.</p>\n<h4>Casting</h4>\n<p>Casting indicates how the Difficulty Number for the Spellcasting test is determined. For many spells, this is the target’s Mystic Defense (abbreviated TMD). For some spells, it is a fixed value, or may be calculated in other ways.</p>\n<h4>Range</h4>\n<p>Range is usually given in yards, and indicates how far away the spell can be targeted. A range of “self” means the spell only works on the caster. “Touch” means the caster must be able to touch the target, which could be the caster. A magician trying to cast a touch spell on an unwilling target does not need to make an additional test (like a Dexterity test) to touch the target, a successful Spellcasting test means the caster has touched the target.</p>\n<h4>Area of Effect</h4>\n<p>Some spells affect multiple targets in a given area, or affect a space rather than an individual. These spells will have an area of effect, usually measured as a radius in yards. This is measured from the spell’s origin point, as indicated based on the range. For example, a spell with a range of “Touch” and an area of effect of 10 yards, will cover a 10 yard radius area, centered on a point within the magician’s reach. If the spell had a range of 100 yards, the center point of the effect could be anywhere within 100 yards of the caster, but would still only cover a 10 yard radius area at that spot.</p>\n<p>A spell affects all targets within its area of effect, regardless of whether they are friend or foe; it is possible for a careless magician to damage allies with an area effect damaging spell. Many spells with an area of effect allow a caster to weave additional threads to designate characters in the spell’s area of effect that will not be affected by the spell.</p>\n<h4>Duration</h4>\n<p>Duration is the amount of time a spell effect lasts. This could be measured in rounds, minutes, hours, or some other increment of time. Unless otherwise noted, “Rank” in a spell duration refers to the casting magician’s Spellcasting rank. For example, a duration of “Rank+10 minutes” on a spell cast by a magician with Spellcasting rank 5 would last for 15 minutes.</p>\n<h4>Effect</h4>\n<p>A spell’s effect depends on the spell. The most common effect is used to determine a value, like the amount of damage dealt. When a spell requires a magician to make an Effect test, the Step number used for the test will be given. For example, “WIL+5” indicates the caster uses his Willpower Step +5 for the Effect test.</p>\n<p>If a spell causes damage, the Effect Step will be followed by the type of armor that resists the damage; Physical or Mystic. If the spell has a fixed effect, rather than a random one, the specifics of the effect will be listed here.</p>\n<h4>Description</h4>\n<p>The spell description will include any special rules or instructions that apply to the spell and its effect. This will include keywords that may relate to the spell. It will also include any gestures or materials required to cast the spell. If the magician is not able to perform the required actions, or does not have the necessary materials, he cannot cast the spell.</p>\n<p>Some spells have slightly different versions that allow a caster to generate different effects. Each version is considered to be a different spell for the purposes of learning time and cost, and are sometimes listed separately. If a magician knows both versions of the spell, however, they can place them both in the same matrix, and can choose which version to cast at any time. These spells are indicated with a note in the description that it can be placed in the same matrix as another spell.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Rensil the Illusionist knows the Ephemeral Bolt and True Ephemeral Bolt spells. The spell descriptions indicate they may be held in the same matrix. If Rensil chooses to keep them in the same matrix, he can decide each time he casts the spell which version (either illusory or real) he is using. </em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>If a spell or other effect targets a matrix that has multiple spells, whether to dislodge or otherwise affect the spell within, all spells are affected. Some spells (typically binding spells) indicate that they can only have one active casting at a time, or have a restriction that might prevent them from being cast again within a certain timeframe. These limits are on the magician.</p>\n<h4>Keywords</h4>\n<p>As mentioned above, the spell description will include any relevant keywords. The most common keywords found in spells are:</p>\n<p>Illusion, Figment: These keywords indicate whether a spell is considered a figment or is a “true illusion” subject to Sensing tests (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.WOvuttoVddSZgN7k]{Illusions}).</p>\n<p>Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Wood: These keywords indicate the spell uses a particular element. This can interact with different resistances or vulnerabilities, or may interact with other effects. These keywords may also reference an elemental sub-type, such as cold or lightning.</p>\n<p>Binding: Some spells bind a summoned spirit to a willing target. A character may only be affected by one binding at a time, which includes any form of involuntary possession. Binding spells grant bonuses to the target, but also require or prohibit certain behaviors. Failure to follow these rules ends the spell. While the spell is in effect, the target’s appearance will alter to reflect the nature of the spirit that is bound to them for the duration. It may be subtle, but there is no hiding the otherworldly influence. Using spells in this way makes many Namegivers nervous, as they lack the proper understanding about the differences between Horrors and other spirits.</p>\n<h4>Success Levels</h4>\n<p>After the spell description is an indication of the effect of additional successes on the Spellcasting test. This is different for each spell, but could be additional Effect Steps, extended duration, ability to affect additional targets, or other options. The indicated bonus applies for each additional success. For example, a spell with “Increase Duration (+2 Rounds)” would extend the duration by 4 Rounds with two extra successes.</p>\n<h4>Extra Threads</h4>\n<p>More experienced casters can use their knowledge of spell patterns and thread weaving to make their spells more powerful. Extra Threads indicates what enhanced effects the caster can add to their spell by weaving additional threads into the spell pattern (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.zzMT9RP7z6nATWnR]{Spellcasting sequence}). Each additional thread can have a different effect, or the magician may choose to have the same effect for each extra thread woven.</p>\n<p>The normal rules for thread weaving apply. The magician must weave all threads before they can cast the spell, and they must decide how many additional threads they are weaving before they begin. If a spell that normally requires no threads is placed in an Enhanced Matrix, the caster may use the thread to enhance the spell effect but the additional effect must be chosen at the time the spell is placed in the matrix.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>The Earth Darts spell indicates that additional threads can extend the duration of the armor reducing effect by 2 rounds, increase the damage of the spell by 2 Steps, reduce the target’s armor by an additional 2 points, increase the range by 10 yards, or strike an additional target.</em></p>\n<p><em>If a magician weaves two additional threads, he could increase the range by 10 yards and increase the Damage Step by 2, increase the range by 20 yards, increase the Damage Step by 4, or any other combination of enhanced effects.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>If an additional thread indicates “Rank” as a modifier, the magician can have each additional thread provide a bonus up to his Spellcasting rank.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Maloren, Kira, Herekar, Ulm, and Silar are getting ready to attack a bandit camp. Shortly before they charge, Maloren casts Air Armor, weaving an extra thread to affect multiple targets. His Spellcasting rank is 5, meaning he can affect up to five additional characters with the spell, for a total of six. This is more than enough to target the entire group with one casting.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p> </p>"},"_id":"uUms4z2NcGpAayHc","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747836811,"modifiedTime":1671747853743,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"HsFiUFTciLyyxDOQ","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

As described above, thread magic allows a character to connect his True Pattern to another True Pattern. A Pattern Item acts as a conduit to another True Pattern, allowing the connection to be made. Pattern items do not have True Patterns of their own; they are only related to a True Pattern, and act as a channel for magical energy. A character cannot weave threads to his own Pattern Items, as a character would be taking energy from his True Pattern and simply putting it back in.</p>\n<p>The basic process for weaving threads to Named people and places is similar to the process used for weaving threads to magic items. The character wishing to weave a thread learns a Key Knowledge, and then weaves a thread to the True Pattern. There are some notable differences, however, and these are detailed in the following sections.</p>\n<h4>Obtain the Key Knowledge</h4>\n<p>Just as with magic items, using thread magic against a Named person or place requires Key Knowledges. Each Key Knowledge is a piece of information about the True Pattern, and through understanding the Key Knowledges, one can affect a True Pattern with magic.</p>\n<p>This can be done in a few ways. The most common method of obtaining a True Pattern’s Key Knowledges is to obtain and study one or more of its Pattern Items.</p>\n<h4>Obtaining a Pattern Item</h4>\n<p>Pattern items are obtained through adventuring, using reasoning and roleplaying to find them. Pattern items are important objects. They are not easily found, and obtaining them often involves overcoming opposition. In a world of magical thought, many people and creatures know the value of Pattern Items, and guard them accordingly. It is also known that to benefit from a Pattern Item you must keep the item in your possession.</p>\n<p>A True Pattern typically has between zero and five Pattern Items. Only characters and places with a True Pattern can have Pattern Items. The more powerful a character or place, the more Pattern Items are likely to exist.</p>\n<p>Scholars have long noted that Pattern Items are usually created in a flexible sequence.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first Pattern Item created for a character or place is always a Minor Pattern Item.</li>\n<li>A Major Pattern Item can only be created once a Minor Pattern Item exists.</li>\n<li>A Core Pattern Item can only be created after the creation of a Major Pattern Item.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The sequence is flexible because it never requires the creation of Major or Core Pattern Items. Nor does it require that Minor Pattern Items be “upgraded” to Major or Core Pattern Items. Death’s Sea, for example, might have five Pattern Items, all of them Minor. While the Blood Wood, on the other hand, might have only one Pattern Item, a withered birch that is a Core Pattern Item.</p>\n<h4>Key Knowledge</h4>\n<p>Each Pattern Item holds one Key Knowledge about a True Pattern. Minor Pattern Items holds knowledge that is related, but not integral to the True Pattern. Major Pattern Items hold knowledge that is an important part of the True Pattern. Core Pattern Items hold knowledge that is an essential part of the True Pattern. In addition to learning the Key Knowledge held by a Pattern Item, it is necessary to know the truth behind the knowledge the Pattern Item represents. </p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Maloren enters the village of Cliffside, hunting a horror cult that has been plaguing the area. While there he hears about a young woman that drove away one of the corrupted cultists with a talisman dedicated to Astendar. Maloren learns that Astendar has some kind of connection to the cult, and suspects it is the kind of information associated with a Pattern Item. Maloren needs the talisman that drove off the cultist; it is most likely a Minor Pattern Item.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>The knowledge in a Pattern Item always represents a portion of the target’s pattern knowledge. When trying to discover the knowledge linked to a Pattern Item, a character should look for the types of Key Knowledges associated with a True Pattern:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Name associated with the True Pattern.</li>\n<li>Ways the person or place uses, is affected by, or interacts with magic.</li>\n<li>The person or place’s history, behaviors, and interactions with magic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As an example, knowing that a Troubadour visited the Lost Thundra Tavern last week is not the kind of information connected to a Pattern Item—that information would not help a character know where the Troubadour is now, where he might be in the future, or even his preference in taverns. However, if the character learns that the Troubadour performs at the Lost Thundra Tavern every Thursday, that is something useful. Repetition of this behavior may have some connection to the Troubadour’s True Pattern. This piece of information could be strong enough to be connected to a Pattern Item.</p>\n<p>Remember that knowledge alone is not enough. A character must also have a Pattern Item that exemplifies what he has learned about a True Pattern. Using the previous example, a character might discover that a particular mug from the Lost Thundra Tavern is the Pattern Item.</p>\n<h4>Studying a Pattern Item</h4>\n<p>Once obtained, a Pattern Item can be studied in order to use the Key Knowledge that it contains. Learning (or  confirming) the Key Knowledge of a Pattern Item is the same as learning the Key Knowledge of a magic item. The  character studies the item using the Item History talent. The item’s Mystic Defense is determined by the gamemaster, based on the type of Pattern Item studied. The Pattern Item Mystic Defense Table shows the typical Mystic Defense range for each type of Pattern Item.</p>\n<p>If the Item History test succeeds, the character learns the Test Knowledge held by the Pattern Item. This knowledge is related to the relationship between the Pattern Item and the True Pattern it represents.</p>\n<p>Because of this, further research may not be necessary; the research has already been done to figure out what the Pattern Item might be. However, the Item History talent is used to confirm that the item is a Pattern Item and that the research done to identify the item as a Pattern Item is the correct Research Knowledge. If no research was done to identify a Pattern Item, Research Knowledge must be learned as with magical items.</p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align:center\">Pattern Item Mystic Defense Table</h5>\n<table style=\"width:100.007%;height:64px\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"background-color:#95a5a6\">\n<td style=\"width:42.1945%;height:16px\">\n<p>Pattern Item</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:57.0892%;height:16px\">\n<p>Mystic Defense Range</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:42.1945%;height:16px\">Minor </td>\n<td style=\"width:57.0892%;height:16px\">7–12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:42.1945%;height:16px\">Major </td>\n<td style=\"width:57.0892%;height:16px\">13–18</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:42.1945%;height:16px\"><span style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05)\">Core </span></td>\n<td style=\"width:57.0892%;height:16px\">19+</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>Repeated Study Attempts</h4>\n<p>If the Item History Test fails, the character may try again after another period of study.</p>\n<p>This period of additional study time comes with some risk; the more a character studies a Pattern Item, the more the item comes in contact with the character’s own True Pattern, and the weaker its connection to the target True Pattern becomes. The character must be careful not to destroy the item’s value as a Pattern Item. This caution slows the pace of study. The more attempts the character makes, the longer he must wait between attempts to avoid contaminating the Pattern Item. The Study Time Table lists the waiting time required after failed attempts. The time required increases, as the Pattern Item has more contact with the studying character, and the effects of the cumulative contact take more time to fade. Each day of study requires that the character examine the Pattern Item for at least one hour each day (as per the description for the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.talent-description.839auhCIcI61JNJ8]{Historia przedmiotu}). Once the character succeeds at an Item History Test, the character has learned the Test Knowledge for that Pattern Item and no further tests are required. </p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align:center\">Study Time Table</h5>\n<table style=\"width:100.437%;height:156px\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:12px;background-color:#95a5a6\">\n<td style=\"width:39.7399%;height:12px\">\n<p>Attempt Number</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:59.5438%;height:12px\">\n<p>Required Waiting Time</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:39.7399%;height:16px\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width:59.5438%;height:16px\">1 week</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:39.7399%;height:16px\">3</td>\n<td style=\"width:59.5438%;height:16px\">2 weeks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:39.7399%;height:16px\">4</td>\n<td style=\"width:59.5438%;height:16px\">3 weeks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:39.7399%;height:16px\">5</td>\n<td style=\"width:59.5438%;height:16px\">4 weeks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:39.7399%;height:16px\">6</td>\n<td style=\"width:59.5438%;height:16px\">5 weeks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:39.7399%;height:16px\">7</td>\n<td style=\"width:59.5438%;height:16px\">6 weeks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:39.7399%;height:16px\">8</td>\n<td style=\"width:59.5438%;height:16px\">7 weeks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:39.7399%;height:16px\">9</td>\n<td style=\"width:59.5438%;height:16px\">8 weeks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:39.7399%;height:16px\">10+</td>\n<td style=\"width:59.5438%;height:16px\">3 months</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>Research</h4>\n<p>People, places and things important enough to have True Patterns tend to be remembered by those who interact with them. For example, the Name of the Archer who killed the Horror terrorizing a village is likely to be a part of the village’s history. By researching the history and activities of a True Pattern, it is possible to obtain its Research Knowledges. This research may have time limits; legends tell of Wizards spending years researching a True Pattern, only to discover that the pattern had changed so much before they could use the Key Knowledges obtained that their research was wasted.</p>\n<p>To research a True Pattern the character may use the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.skill-description.Research]{Wyszukiwanie informacji}. To obtain information, he makes a Research test against the Difficulty Number of the information sought. The gamemaster determines this number by estimating how hard the task should be (for more information on determining Difficuly Numbers, see @Compendium[EarthdawnGMCompendium.gamemasters-guide.Creating Difficulty Numbers]{Creating Difficulty Numbers} in the GM Guide).</p>\n<h4>Spend Legend Points</h4>\n<p>Once a character knows one or more Key Knowledges of a True Pattern, he can weave a thread to the True Pattern. As with magic items, he must spend Legend Points to pay for the desired Thread Rank. The Legend Point cost of Thread Ranks woven to the True Patterns of people and places is the same as for improving Ranks of a Novice talent (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.C0QyYIkycXSryUne]{Improving Talent Ranks}). Thread Rank costs are determined just like Ranks for talents. The cost for increasing the Rank of a thread depends on the new Rank.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Tomas wants to weave a Rank 1 thread to connect to the True Pattern of a foe. Consulting the Talent Rank Cost Table, his player sees that this would cost Tomas 100 Legend Points.</em></p>\n<p><em>Neska wants to increase the Rank of a thread she has attached to the True Pattern of Blood Wood. The thread is currently Rank 3. Consulting the Talent Rank Cost Table, her player finds the cost of increasing the Rank from 3 to 4 is 500 Legend Points.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Thread Rank Limits</h4>\n<p>The maximum Rank for a thread woven to the True Pattern of a person or place depends on the type of Pattern Item being used. Minor Pattern Items can have a maximum Rank 5 thread; Major Pattern Items can support threads up to Rank 9; Core Pattern Items can support up to Rank 15 threads. The maximum Thread Rank is still limited by the Thread Weaving Rank of the character weaving the thread; if the character’s Thread Weaving Rank is lower, the lower limit applies. </p>\n<h4>Weave the Thread</h4>\n<p>After a character has spent Legend Points for the Thread Rank, he can weave the thread to the subject’s True Pattern. The character must be in possession of the Pattern Item he studied in order to successfully weave the thread and benefit from it. The Pattern Item is a material link between the character and the True Pattern to which he is weaving the thread.</p>\n<p>The character makes a Thread Weaving test against a Difficulty Number based on the Thread Rank, as shown in the .@Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.813iyTH3xezbcKtq]{Thread Weaving Difficulty Table} If the Thread Weaving Test succeeds, the character has woven a thread to the True Pattern. Because Minor Pattern Items are only loosely connected to a subject’s True Pattern, Thread Weaving tests made with them require an extra success. A single Pattern Item can have only one thread tied to it. When increasing the Rank of a pre-existing thread, the new thread replaces the previous one. As with Thread Weaving Tests for Thread Items, if the test fails the character can make no further attempts at weaving the thread for a day. The old thread (if one existed) is not lost, but the Legend Points spent remain invested and cannot be used for another purpose.</p>\n<h4>Using Woven Threads</h4>\n<p>When a character weaves a thread to a True Pattern, that act establishes a link between the character’s True Pattern and the True Pattern of the target. The weaving character can use that link to boost one or more of his own abilities when interacting with the subject of the True Pattern. To do this, he attaches the thread to one of the following abilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any one Talent</li>\n<li>Physical Defense</li>\n<li>Mystic Defense</li>\n<li>Social Defense</li>\n<li>Wound Threshold</li>\n<li>Mystic Armor</li>\n<li>Durability Rating</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When the character interacts with the True Pattern to which he has woven a thread, the Thread Rank increases the ability to which it is attached. In the case of talents, this increases the Rank and affects the Step and anything else based on the talent rank, such as the talent’s duration. The increased Rank does not count when checking to see if the character qualifies to advance to the next Circle (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.v2ONo6b5lLIECtHn]{Advancing Discipline Circles}). For other abilities, each Thread Rank increases the value of the ability by one.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Kira weaves a Rank 2 thread from the True Pattern of Larren, a rival Thief, to her Melee Weapons talent. This thread increases her Melee Weapons talent by 2 Ranks when interacting with Larren, which usually involves attacking him with her sword.</em></p>\n<p><em>Rensil weaves a Rank 3 thread from the True Pattern of the cultist known as Dreamstalker to his Mystic Defense, increasing the rating +3 whenever he is interacting with the enemy magician—such as when Dreamstalker uses an ability that targets Rensil’s Mystic Defense.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>The number of abilities that can be increased by a single thread is based on the type of Pattern Item used to attach the thread. A Minor Pattern Item can only increase one ability. A Major Pattern Item can increase up to three abilities. A thread woven to a Core Pattern Item can increase up to five abilities. When increasing multiple abilities, all attached abilities are increased by the thread’s Rank.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>After successfully studying a Major Pattern Item belonging to Larren, Kira weaves a Rank 3 thread to three abilities: her Melee Weapons talent, her Physical Defense, and her Social Defense. When interacting with the Thief, Kira’s Melee Weapons talent is increased by +3 Ranks, while her Physical and Social Defense are increased by +3 each.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h4>People</h4>\n<p>When a character weaves a thread to the True Pattern of another person, the weaver can use the link created in one of two ways. He can use it to boost his abilities when interacting with the subject—this generally means targeting or being targeted by the subject—or it can be used to boost the abilities of the subject at all times; the subject’s True Pattern draws energy from the weaver’s True Pattern through the thread, strengthening it. In either case, the weaving character must keep the pattern item for the benefit to apply.</p>\n<p>When a character wants to boost the abilities of the subject, he can choose any of the same abilities listed above. Threads used in this way otherwise work as already described. A character must choose how he will use the thread when he first creates it. Once he has chosen, the thread cannot be changed to any other use. </p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Ulm Curvehorn has obtained a Minor Pattern Item for Mica. After studying the Pattern Item and learning its Key Knowledge, Ulm weaves a Rank 1 thread to Mica’s True Pattern to boost his Physical Defense. Once the thread is in place, Mica’s Physical Defense increases by one.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Places</h4>\n<p>Just like threads woven to people, a character can weave a thread to the True Pattern of a place in one of two ways. The choice is made at the time the thread is first woven and, once woven, cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>First, a character can use the Thread Ranks to boost abilities, as described above. The thread strengthens the character as long as he remains in that place. For example, if a character has a thread woven to the True Pattern of Blood Wood, the Thread Rank would boost the character’s abilities as long as he was in Blood Wood. If the character leaves Blood Wood the benefit of the thread is lost, but he regains it as soon as he re-enters the Wood.</p>\n<p>Second, the character can increase various game ratings associated with a place. For example, a Wizard might increase the Armor Rating of the walls of his tower, the Difficulty Number to open the locks on his doors, or even simply enhance the appearance of his library. As noted above, the Thread Rank determines the rating increase. Either way, the character must retain possession of the pattern item for the benefit to apply.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Tomas weaves a Rank 5 thread to the True Pattern of his laboratory. He decides to use the thread to make opening locks in his lab a harder proposition for potential intruders. The Difficulty Number for Lock Picking tests in Tomas’s lab increases by +5 with the help of the thread.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Unweaving Threads</h4>\n<p><strong>Optional Rule: </strong>Adepts may wish to remove, or “unweave,” threads they have previously woven for a variety of reasons. An adept who has unwittingly woven a thread to a cursed or Horror-marked item may want to unweave the thread to escape the effects of the curse or Horror mark. An adept may simply have reached his thread limit but still feel the need to weave a thread to a different pattern. Rather than increasing his Thread Weaving Rank or allowing one of his threads to be displaced, he may simply want to unweave a thread. </p>\n<p>The optional Unweaving Threads rule provides adepts with a means to do so. To unweave a thread under this rule, an adept takes 5 Strain and must achieve 3 Successes on a Thread Weaving test against a Difficulty Number equal to his unmodified Mystic Defense plus the thread Rank. For example, if a Wizard with a Mysitc Defense of 10 wants to remove a Rank 5 thread he has attached to a thread item, he needs three successes on a Thread Weaving (15) test.</p>\n<p>Adepts cannot unweave threads woven by others. When unweaving a thread, the character does not recover the Legend Points he spent weaving the thread.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</blockquote>"},"_id":"qqtkv1DXF4odUopA","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747834374,"modifiedTime":1671747853640,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"IaaGSm6ifefyQW0j","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Grimoires","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Once a magician has learned a spell, he can cast the spell from memory, simply by channeling magical energy through a properly attuned spell matrix. So why should a magician keep a grimoire? There are several reasons for doing so, most of which relate to training and teaching. A grimoire is more than a collection of the spells a magician has learned. It is a record of a magician’s growth in his Discipline, through Novice and Journeyman, to Warden and Master.</p>\n<p>Though a grimoire is often defined as a book of spells, implying a bundle of paper, grimoires come in many shapes and sizes and can be written on almost any type of material. Some are thick tomes with spells inscribed on the pages. Another might be a bag of coins with runes finely etched on the silver. Others might be sticks of bone. Some might be written on gems, the spells appearing only under moonlight. The shape of a grimoire is limited only by the knowledge and idiosyncrasies of its owner. Magicians also use their grimoires to record other information, such as spell research and runic carvings for later study. As magicians advance to higher Circles, they learn methods for incorporating various effects into new spells they design. All of this information is recorded in their grimoire.</p>\n<p>When considering new students, many magicians want to review a candidate’s grimoire. This enables the teacher to examine the student’s past experiences and gauge his knowledge of the Discipline’s spells. Some magicians refuse to instruct adepts who do not maintain grimoires or treat their grimoires poorly, because they believe such students lack respect for the traditions of their Discipline and the craft of spellcasting.</p>\n<p>Grimoires also enable magicians to share spells with other adepts of their Discipline. An adept learning a spell must be able to copy the spell from a written document, so any magician who wishes to share spells or take on students must keep a grimoire.</p>\n<p>Although it is an uncommon practice, magicians are known to write down single spells onto paper or other materials. Spells written down in this manner can be sold or stored as backup copies in case the magician’s grimoire is lost or destroyed. Additionally, a magician’s grimoire frequently becomes one of his pattern items. Though grimoires typically begin as a Minor pattern item, they may eventually become a Major or even Core pattern item. By keeping his grimoire with him, a magician can keep that connection from being used against him.</p>\n<p>Although it is often a pattern item, the Mystic Defense of a grimoire is equal to the Dispel Difficulty of the highest-Circle spell it contains (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.Ts3JsNe5mzodEHj4]{Dispelling Magic}).</p>"},"_id":"K8smwMZ5yXBhsyx3","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747836483,"modifiedTime":1671747853690,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"JR660aD8Hmx6eq6o","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Tales abound of artists visited by Astendar spending a feverish night alternately working at the easel and making love with the Passion. Such inspirational gifts are not lightly given; visits from Astendar usually mark an individual for artistic greatness. Astendar also takes an interest in lovers young and old. One well-known tale involves a widow and widower who wanted to marry. Their children, however,<img style=\"float:right;margin:5px\" src=\"modules/ed4pgpl/assets/pictures/harp.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"231\" /> believed them too old for romance and discouraged the courtship. Kept locked in their houses by their children, the couple appealed to Astendar for help. The Passion agreed to aid them if they created a painting together. At first, the couple had no idea how they might do this, for they could not meet or see each other, but driven by their longing to marry, they came up with a plan.</p>\n<p>The couple hired a Thief adept they knew to carry a canvas back and forth between their houses. Every night for weeks, one of them would add to the painting, and the thief would carry it to the other house just before dawn. As the painting neared completion, the lovers found themselves waiting more and more anxiously every night to see the other’s handiwork. Slowly but surely, Astendar’s painting turned friendship and gentle affection into excitement, anticipation, and deepening love.</p>\n<p>When the couple finished the picture, they were astounded by the beauty of their work. The painting so pleased Astendar that she made the couple young once more. Bolstered by their renewed strength, the couple escaped and ran away together. As for the Thief, he was rewarded with the painting, which he sold for a handsome price.</p>\n<p><strong>Ideals:</strong> Love, Art, Music</p>\n<p><strong>Typical Appearance:</strong> Astendar commonly manifests as a powerfully built male or female of any race, wearing few garments and carrying a musical instrument.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Elements: </strong>Light rain, music, beautiful clothing of intricate textures</p>\n<p><strong>Powers:</strong> Astendar can entrance listeners with music, instill lust or love, restore youth, and transform into the sound of a song and float through the air, leaving the melody in her wake.</p>\n<p><strong>Questors:</strong> Artists make up the largest percentage of questors of Astendar. These questors find sensual pleasures such as gourmet food, luxurious clothing, or a lingering kiss fascinating. Their determination to imitate Astendar by indulging their desires often leads them into trouble. Because they know their actions are inspired by their Passion, they naively believe everyone else will see their actions in the same light. Sadly, others usually view the indulgences of questors of Astendar as decadence unchecked by self-control or common sense.</p>"},"_id":"rgxVMz5iSgg4n4ow","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747832367,"modifiedTime":1671747854116,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"JkbSfVo1qwG9cfQr","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

He does not know Haggle, but it is a default skill, so he can attempt to use it. Moran gets one chance to make a successful Charisma test to negotiate a better price. Smiling, the merchant listens to the dwarf’s stumbling attempt at explaining why he should pay less for the item.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Default Skills</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Animal Handling</li>\n<li>Avoid Blow</li>\n<li>Awareness</li>\n<li>Bribery</li>\n<li>Climbing</li>\n<li>Conversation</li>\n<li>Distract</li>\n<li>Etiquette</li>\n<li>Flirting</li>\n<li>Haggle</li>\n<li>Melee Weapons</li>\n<li>Missile Weapons</li>\n<li>Research</li>\n<li>Resist Taunt</li>\n<li>Seduction</li>\n<li>Slough Blame</li>\n<li>Swimming</li>\n<li>Throwing Weapons</li>\n<li>Tracking</li>\n<li>Unarmed Combat</li>\n<li>Wilderness Survival</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Skill Tests</h3>\n<p>To make a skill test (usually referred to by the name of the skill, for instance, an Etiquette test), the character rolls the dice indicated by the skill Step. For the test to be successful, the result must be at least equal to the Difficulty Number.

This frequently causes damage to the magician, and can have other harmful side effects. A magician can use raw magic to cast any spell he knows, that is, any spell he has successfully transferred to his grimoire, regardless of Circle.</p>\n<p>When casting a spell with raw magic, the magician weaves spell threads and casts the spell as normal. Spells cast<img style=\"float:right;margin:8px\" src=\"modules/ed4pgpl/assets/pictures/earth-darts.jpg\" width=\"325\" height=\"183\" /> with raw magic have the same effect and duration as spells cast using spell matrices. The differences are the potential consequences to the magician: Warping, Damage, and Horror Mark tests. The likelihood and severity of these side effects depend on the local corruption of astral space.</p>\n<h4>Warping and Damage</h4>\n<p>The amount of Warping and Damage a magician suffers when casting raw magic is based on the Circle of the spell, and the local classification of astral space. For more information on the different astral regions, see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.iczS86SqzTx8GDmp]{Astral Space}.</p>\n<p>When a magician casts a spell using raw magic, the gamemaster makes a Warping test against the magicians’ natural Mystic Defense. The Step used for the Warping test is found on the Raw Magic Table. Because warping is an internal process, any items, spells, or other effects that increase the magician’s Mystic Defense do not provide any bonuses. If the test succeeds, the gamemaster makes a Damage test using the Step shown in the Raw Magic Table. Because this damage is internal, only the character’s natural Mystic Armor provides protection.</p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align:center\">Raw Magic Table</h5>\n<table style=\"width:100.294%;height:74px\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"background-color:#95a5a6\">\n<td style=\"width:28.8866%;height:10px\">\n<p>Region Type</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:23.7633%;height:10px\">\n<p>Warping Step</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:21.2688%;height:10px\">\n<p>Damage Step</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:25.0785%;height:10px\">\n<p>Horror Mark Step**</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:28.8866%;height:16px\">Safe</td>\n<td style=\"width:23.7633%;height:16px\">Circle*</td>\n<td style=\"width:21.2688%;height:16px\">Circle +4</td>\n<td style=\"width:25.0785%;height:16px\">NA</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:28.8866%;height:16px\">Open</td>\n<td style=\"width:23.7633%;height:16px\">Circle +5</td>\n<td style=\"width:21.2688%;height:16px\">Circle  +8</td>\n<td style=\"width:25.0785%;height:16px\">Circle  +2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:28.8866%;height:16px\">Tainted</td>\n<td style=\"width:23.7633%;height:16px\"><span style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05)\">Circle  +10</span></td>\n<td style=\"width:21.2688%;height:16px\"><span style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05)\">Circle  +12</span></td>\n<td style=\"width:25.0785%;height:16px\"><span style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05)\">Circle +5</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:28.8866%;height:16px\">Corrupt</td>\n<td style=\"width:23.7633%;height:16px\">Circle +15</td>\n<td style=\"width:21.2688%;height:16px\">Circle +16</td>\n<td style=\"width:25.0785%;height:16px\">Circle +10</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>* Circle refers to the Circle of the spell being cast.</p>\n<p>** The Horror Mark Step cannot exceed the Horror’s Spellcasting Step.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Rensil wants to cast a Second Circle spell using raw magic.

The gamemaster rolls a 12 on the Warping test. The damaged astral space warps Rensil’s spell, and so the raw magic hurts him. The gamemaster makes a Step 14 Damage test and gets a result of 17. Rensil’s natural Mystic Armor is 2, so he takes 15 Damage Points from the backlash.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Horror Mark</h4>\n<p>A spell cast using raw magic is like launching a flare on a dark night. The unmasked magic might attract unwanted attention from astral entities. Many magicians doomed themselves before the Scourge by casting raw magic against the first signs of the Horrors. These people were not foolish, but they had no way of knowing the consequences of their actions. Spell matrices were only developed after the survivors saw (or heard) what became of these unfortunate magicians.</p>\n<p>When a character uses raw magic, the gamemaster makes a Horror Mark test against the caster’s natural Mystic Defense. If successful, a Horror has noticed the caster and marked him. A Horror Mark is a Horror’s personal gateway to a character; the Horror may use the gateway any time it wishes, though range may restrict some of its options. Horrors may use the mark to locate their victim at any time.</p>\n<p>Many Horrors have ways of communicating with marked victims who are hundreds of miles away, and some can cast spells on their victims from a great distance. A Horror Mark lasts for a year and a day, but the Horror may renew the Horror Mark for another year and a day if it wishes. There may be range restrictions, but aside from being out of range, there is no known way of preventing a live Horror from renewing its mark. Horrors have been known to quietly renew their Horror Marks for years, without the victim being aware of the mark. For more information on Horror Marks, see the Gamemaster’s Guide.</p>"},"_id":"pbtFHD4vS7mubOUn","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747836639,"modifiedTime":1671747853721,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"KjnYDxfHBNLfHCRS","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Though there are talents and spells used to summon specific types of spirits, this chapter provides general rules for summoning in Earthdawn.</p>\n<p>There are several methods of summoning that adepts can use to call on spirits. The most versatile ability is the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.talent-description.elQihszsigruwrHQ]{Summon ()} talent. It allows adepts to call spirits with a wide range of powers. Other talents and spells also summon spirits, and often more easily than using the Summon talent, but the spirits summoned are usually limited in power or called for a specific purpose. Regardless of the method used, the test made to summon a spirit is called the Summoning test.</p>\n<p><img style=\"float:left;margin:8px\" src=\"modules/ed4pgpl/assets/pictures/blind-nethermancer.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"383\" />Like the Thread Weaving talent, each Summon talent is unique and can only be used to summon spirits of a certain type. For example, Elementalists summon elemental spirits with this talent, while Nethermancers summon ally spirits.</p>\n<p>The rules in this chapter provide an overview of summoning and banishing spirits by use of the Summon talent. @Compendium[earthdawn-gm-compendium.gamemasters-guide.sRS3hH903aYLWh8z]{Spirit Descriptions} can be found in the Gamemaster’s Guide .</p>\n<h3>On Spirits</h3>\n<p>While spirits can be summoned by player characters, they still pose some mystery, no matter how powerful the summoner may be. Some general information on spirits is known to adepts who receive summoning abilities as part of their Discipline. There are several categories and types of spirits:</p>\n<p>Tasked Spirits are simple spirits with capabilities limited to a certain task. They are usually summoned by spells such as Summon Fog Ghost or talents such as Orbiting Spy, and their summoning and other related rules are governed by the rules for the spell or talent.</p>\n<p>Elemental Spirits are spirits of the five elements and usually summoned by Elementalists. Ally Spirits are more mysterious than elemental spirits. Usually living in strange planes in the Netherworlds, they either originate from the Netherworlds or are spirits of deceased Namegivers. They are the domain of Nethermancers. </p>\n<p>Invae is the name given to a group of insect-like spirits from the Netherworlds. They are often mistaken for Horrors, as they try to break through to the physical world, but are very different in nature.</p>\n<p>Named spirits are most often the spirits of deceased Namegivers (ally spirits), although any spirit can have a Name if given one. They follow the rules of the type of spirit they are, but require their Name to be known or one of their Pattern Items to be present during their summoning.</p>\n<p>Spirits have a Strength Rating measuring their raw power. It is added to many of a spirit’s base characteristics to determine a spirit’s abilities and governs the number of powers a spirit can have. While adepts can learn talents to summon and communicate with spirits, it should be understood that spirits are still very alien to player characters. They have different mindsets, agendas, and concepts of time and space (even if they were once Namegivers). </p>"},"_id":"ECiQyKMdwYbIEF0n","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747832693,"modifiedTime":1671747853756,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"L30k0W196WLtTRzG","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

This debate has only grown in the wake of the Scourge. Most common folk find the debate pointless, as whatever their origins, the Passions are real beings that have the potential to affect daily life. Those who channel the power of the Passions are called questors. Unlike adepts, these men and women draw their extraordinary powers from the Passions. The magical forces of the universe flow through the Passions to their questors. The questors then bring the Passions to the common folk across the world. Following a Passion gives a questor the same kind of focus an adept receives by following the tenets of his Discipline. The questor’s life becomes a living metaphor for the ideals embodied by his chosen Passion; throughout his life, he strives to express those ideals in word and action. Most questors fervently and vividly live out this commitment, adding as much color and energy to the world as magicians and adepts.</p>\n<p><img style=\"float:right;margin:7px\" src=\"modules/ed4pgpl/assets/pictures/centaur.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"241\" />Most people assume that what is known about the Passions holds true for lands beyond Barsaive. It would be strange if magic interacted with the world in different ways from place to place. Yet the world is often strange, and perhaps magic does change. If the Passions are shaped and brought into being by Namegivers, then Passions known in Barsaive may not exist on the other side of the globe, and other Passions may take their place. It is also possible that men and women in distant lands know the same Passions but call them by different names. Whatever the truth, the Passions are an important part of daily life in Barsaive, and their influence is felt in many ways.</p>\n<h3>The Nature of Passions</h3>\n<p>The Passions are potent beings with powers that dwarf the magical talents and spells of adepts. While they exist on the physical plane, the Passions seem to travel at incredible speeds; some travel as the wind, some take the forms of eagles or hawks, and some transport themselves by simple thought. </p>\n<p>A Passion can appear to one of their questors in Travar one moment, and appear to another Namegiver in Parlainth the next.</p>\n<p>The Passions frequently act through their questors, but can also appear in person. Some adventurers tell stories of meeting the Passion Thystonius while traveling. A group of explorers wandering through a forest may stumble across a humble hut that houses a member of Barsaive’s pantheon. The Passions move these homes as they wish, setting up residence for a day, or for years. The Passion might welcome a polite knock at his door, or visitors had best keep away.</p>\n<p>Legends claim that the Passions do not care about Barsaive’s political alliances and rivalries, and most of their documented behavior supports this. Questors claim the conflicts between kingdoms and cities generates the passions and adventures of life that the universe craves. While they do not typically intercede in worldly conflicts on their own, they will eagerly support any side that calls to them for help— sometimes helping both sides in the same conflict. This influence is shown through their questors. If a questor sides with you, his Passion supports your cause, and the power the questor brings can make the difference between victory and defeat. If the situation demands it, the Passions have been known to send more powerful servants. These servants aren’t Namegivers, despite their appearance. No one is sure what they are, but they are generally referred to as the Passions’ avatars.</p>\n<p>The Passions do not have a fixed appearance. For example, the Passion Thystonius is described in a variety of ways. Humans describe a tall man with a flowing black beard and piercing blue eyes. Trolls tell of a troll carrying a warhammer as heavy as a boulder. Dwarfs speak of a dwarf, standing 50 feet tall, who makes his home in the Throal mountains. These differences in appearance are not confined to race, but encompass gender and other aspects of physical appearance. For example, many people think of the Passion Garlen as a woman, because she is depicted as female in the many statues gracing kaers and villages across Barsaive. But if Garlen comes to them in dreams, often during the deepest crises of their lives, they may see the Passion as a man.</p>\n<p>Most believe these varied appearances occur because a Passion tailors its physical appearance so the individual can easily recognize the ideals and forces embodied by the Passion. However, all the manifestations of a Passion contain certain identifiable, common elements, described later in this chapter.</p>\n<p>Scholars continue to debate whether or not the Passions have a “true” appearance. So far no one has found a definitive answer, and many believe the mystery may never be solved. Most people do not care to know, believing that the true forms of the Passions remain hidden for good reason.</p>\n<h4>Harbingers</h4>\n<p>Many legends tell of the Passions visiting Namegivers in times of great need or rewarding individuals who live with a particular Passion’s ideals in their hearts. However, legends rarely speak of the dire consequences that befall those who anger the Passions. Few people have seen what happens; the angered Passions deal with such miscreants by sending a special kind of avatar: a fearsome creature known as a harbinger.</p>\n<p>One of the best-known tales of a Namegiver who angered the Passions is the legend of Naka. Long before the Scourge, Naka farmed a plot of land in the ancient Kingdom of Landis. He never enjoyed the profits that some of his neighbors earned, but neither did he ever go hungry. Naka largely kept to himself and never spoke ill of others. However, Naka eventually grew resentful of his neighbors’ successes. His resentment grew like a black tumor in his heart.</p>\n<p>One day a terrible storm darkened the skies over Landis. Naka went out into the fields of his neighbors, and invoking Garlen, Passion of the Hearth, he offered his fellow farmers shelter in his large house. He fed them food and wine, and after they fell asleep, Naka massacred them and stole their valuables. Days later, Naka met his end at the feet of an unknown giant; an ethereal-looking, armored knight. Nothing is known about this knight, but people whisper that he was sent by Garlen herself.</p>"},"_id":"GAmq8pFT0FOkslV7","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747832288,"modifiedTime":1671747854095,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"LROIQ41FfKibN8Np","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Magic in our World","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>The following extract is from the writings of Jaron, one of the premier magical</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>scholars of his day. Both the Eternal Library of Thera and the Great Library of Throal</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>consider this work one of the definitive explanations of magic.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>—Merrox, Master of the Hall of Records</em></p>\n<p>Our world is filled with magic, from the simplest flower to the mightiest hero. Magic infuses the bones of the earth itself. Magic is life, penetrating and affecting all that it touches. Magic is such a fundamental part of daily existence that it pervades our every thought and action.</p>\n<p>The workings of magic are complex, and come in many forms, but in the end all are built on a framework that explains how magic interacts with the world. The key ideas in this framework are patterns, Names, pattern knowledge, pattern items, and threads.</p>\n<h4>Patterns</h4>\n<p>Everything has a pattern. A pattern is the magical representation of a person, place, or thing; much like a builder’s plan for a house. This representation is not physical, but metaphysical—how something is formed by and interacts with the magical world. Magical energy is shaped into patterns that define and control what the energy will do. When a magician casts a spell, he is shaping magical energy into a pattern that defines and expresses the effect of the spell. Patterns define the use of magic in all its shapes and forms.</p>\n<p>Patterns are not static. As a pattern interacts with the magical energy of the world, and with other patterns, it can change. These changes might be small and almost impossible to detect, or they could be dramatic—a random stone in a field is unlikely to have its pattern change significantly from day to day, or even over the course of months or years, but a magician enchanting a sword is causing a significant change to the pattern of the sword, giving it more power.</p>\n<p>While everything has a pattern, not all patterns are equal. The more powerful the pattern, the more it can influence the magical world. Some patterns are so complex and significant that sages have coined the term True Patterns. A True Pattern identifies a person, place, or thing as a magically unique individual.</p>\n<p>Like all patterns, a True Pattern defines a person’s abilities, talents, knowledge, history, and experience. Most significantly, this includes the ways the individual uses, or is influenced by, magic. The same holds true for places and things—everything that defines that place’s or object’s relationship with magic from the moment of its creation to the present is part of its True Pattern.</p>\n<h4>Names</h4>\n<p>The difference between lesser patterns and True Patterns is largely a matter of degree, but scholars have found that one thing all True Patterns have that common patterns do not is a Name. A Name is what defines a person, place, or thing as unique, distinguishing it from others of its type. By definition, everything with a Name has a True Pattern.</p>\n<p>You may have a stand of trees behind your home. Like all things it has a pattern, but without a Name there is nothing to distinguish this particular stand of trees from another, and their magical significance is minor. Giving something a Name—Naming it—gives the pattern a greater magical significance, shaping and establishing its True Pattern.</p>\n<p>As you can imagine, this is a powerful force. It is usually done deliberately, with a ritual of some kind—like a child’s coming of age ceremony. However, it can also happen spontaneously. Sages are not certain what magical process is involved in an unintentional Naming, but it almost always seems to arise through the use of powerful magic near a person, place, or thing.</p>\n<p>For example, let’s say that one night a pack of hell hounds chases the hero Samaran into the grove behind your house. There, despite all the courage, strength, and magic he can muster, Samaran is slain. The death of a great hero and the magic surrounding such an event is significant enough to spontaneously Name the grove of trees. It becomes Samaran’s Demise. Now that it has a Name, it has a True Pattern, and has greater magical significance.</p>\n<h4>People</h4>\n<p>People are the most magically complex beings in the world, and all of them have a Name. It is this nature that makes them Namegivers; as intelligent, aware beings their True Pattern is powerful and significant enough to shape the magic of the world into other True Patterns.</p>\n<p>In many cultures Naming occurs just after birth, usually as part of a spiritual ritual. Some cultures allow a child to choose a new Name when they reach adulthood, including this Naming as part of a coming-of-age ceremony. In others, a person can choose to be re-Named as a symbol of a new beginning or new stage of life. Remember that Naming forms and defines a True Pattern—if a person is re- Named, his True Pattern changes. This change is more than symbolic. If the True Pattern changes, his interactions with magic can be redefined, and any magical abilities and knowledge he has could disappear. He could lose the teachings of his Discipline, along with any special abilities or protection it may have brought him. Who and what the person was is—magically speaking—gone. Because re-Naming can change anything and everything about the person, very few people choose to truly be re-Named. More often, they will take on nicknames, titles, monikers, and the like. While these can shape and define a person’s True Pattern, they do not redefine it the way re-Naming does. There are legends of spells and abilities that allow somebody to be re-Named without losing what they were, but no proof of such power is known to exist.</p>\n<h4>Places</h4>\n<p>A place is frequently Named, usually for its association with an important event or powerful magic, as in the example of the Named grove of trees. Many cultures will have Named places for birth and death (sometimes different places, sometimes not), in order to keep random Naming under control. The site of weddings is often Named for the same reason.</p>\n<p>The site of a major battle might be Named, as might the place of a notable surrender or treaty signing. A magician will often Name their inner sanctum; the Naming of such a place contributes to its power, making magical workings there even stronger. Places where powerful magic was used can be spontaneously Named, though rarely. Typically only the most powerful of spells can create a Name, and magicians who use this type of magic are careful to not let it get out of hand.</p>\n<p>A place is sometimes Named in honor of a powerful or notable individual. Such Naming is discouraged, as it can build an echo of the individual’s True Pattern into the True Pattern of the place. Skilled magicians can use this association to their advantage.</p>\n<h4>Things</h4>\n<p>Important items and objects are frequently Named when created. Many magical items demand a Name, since Naming creates the True Pattern that will define the item’s interaction with magic. Without a Name, Fireheart would be a simple broadsword, and Skull-Cleaver nothing more than a well made axe. </p>\n<p>Non-magical items can be Named, frequently by a person who wants to link personal items more strongly to himself. A novice adept aspiring to be a mighty Warrior might Name his weapon. While the confidence inspired by such an act might spur the person to perform heroic deeds, this kind of Naming poses a disadvantage. As with places, the item becomes associated with the individual, and that association can be taken advantage of.</p>\n<h4>Pattern Knowledge</h4>\n<p>As mentioned above, a pattern defines everything about the history and magical interactions of a person, place, or thing. This information is known as the pattern knowledge, and it can be used to influence or tap into the magical power inherent in a pattern. Pattern knowledge includes, but is not limited to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>A history of the pattern, its interactions with magic, significant events, and important behaviors.</li>\n<li>Rules or ways in which the pattern uses, or is affected by, magic.</li>\n<li>The pattern’s Name, usually what we would refer to as a proper noun. This only applies to True Patterns.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most patterns are too complex for somebody to learn all of the pattern knowledge from a given pattern. Fortunately, when trying to study and interact with a given pattern, only a few pieces of information matter. Sages call these specific pieces of information key knowledges. By understanding them, an adept can gain power over the pattern, or give additional power to it.</p>\n<p>The Name of a True Pattern is always one of its Key Knowledges, and usually the first one that must be learned. Otherwise, key knowledges can take many forms. For example, the key knowledges of a certain place might include the Name of the last person to die there, the date the place was built, or the winner of a battle fought there. The key knowledges of a person might include his place of birth, his strong hatred (or love) for another person, or the Name of his favorite weapon.</p>\n<p>The most common use of pattern knowledge by adepts is to take advantage of the power inherent in magical items. By learning the key knowledges of a sword, the adept can bind their pattern to the weapon’s, magically increasing their ability to attack, cause more damage, or cause the blade to burst into flame. A magician could use the magical power of a staff to make his spells more effective when wielding the staff.</p>\n<p>In order to take advantage of the pattern knowledge, you must be interacting with the pattern. For most magical items, this is easily done—you use the item as it is intended. A magic sword must be used to attack, an amulet must be worn, or a magic saddle used on a mount. For other patterns, like those of other people or places, this interaction is achieved through the use of what sages call pattern items.</p>\n<h4>Pattern Items</h4>\n<p>People and places with True Patterns become associated with items that reflect their pattern knowledge. These items have a pattern, but that pattern has become a piece of the True Pattern they are connected to. They are called pattern items, and adepts and other magical practitioners can use them as a way of connecting to the desired True Pattern.</p>\n<p>Troubadours sing many stories of unusual pattern items, items that seem to have little connection to the person or place they represent. These tales are told because they are the exception rather than the rule. Most pattern items are common, familiar objects that are somehow important to a person or place. Proximity to a True Pattern is what infuses something with the magic that makes it a pattern item. Because the ways of magic can be complex and subtle, it is difficult to control what can become a pattern item, even for those well versed in magical lore.</p>\n<p>There are three classes of pattern items: Minor, Major, and Core. There are no guarantees that a True Pattern will have all three types, or even have any pattern items at all.</p>\n<h4>Minor Pattern Items</h4>\n<p>The weakest and most common type, minor pattern items are the most difficult to use because their connection to a True Pattern is so weak. There is nothing to distinguish a minor pattern item from another item of the same type. The proper magical inquiry will uncover its nature, but it has no special properties or increased resistance to damage.</p>\n<p>Minor pattern items are almost always created spontaneously by the whims of magic. They gain power through physical proximity to the magic of a True Pattern. They are often personal possessions, minor features of a place, and so forth. A magician’s walking stick might become a minor pattern item, as might a stone from a tavern where a Questor of Garlen regularly performs healing for travelers and townsfolk.</p>\n<h4>Major Pattern Items</h4>\n<p>Major pattern items have a stronger connection to their related True Pattern. This more direct magical link makes them easier to use and learn about, and easier to use to influence their parent True Pattern. Major pattern items are typically more resistant to damage—a book might singe but not burn, vials might only crack instead of shatter. While it might take more effort to damage them, major pattern items are not indestructible.</p>\n<p>Major pattern items are almost always deliberately created. When they occur spontaneously, it is always in connection with significant events or magic. Because of this, and the strength of their bond with the related True Pattern, they are usually well protected, to prevent their power from falling into the wrong hands.</p>\n<p>Major pattern items are usually items of significant psychological importance to a person or place; a favorite weapon, the wheel of a riverboat, and so on. </p>\n<h4>Core Pattern Items</h4>\n<p>Core pattern items are the strongest and rarest type of pattern item. They are almost never created spontaneously— their creation invariably marks a significant event or turning point in the life of a person or place. Their powerful magical potential means that they are generally well known, and equally well protected. A person or place will only ever have one core pattern item.</p>\n<p>Core pattern items are even more durable than major pattern items, because of two additional advantages. First, an aura of luck seems to surround them. If events can conspire to protect the item, they will. Second, if a core pattern item is destroyed, the magical energies of the world work to recreate the item. This could take anywhere from a few days to more than a year, and the restored item could appear anywhere.</p>\n<p>A core pattern item has an intrinsic spiritual significance to the person or place it is associated with, representing who or what they are in almost every respect. For example, a king’s crown could be the core pattern item for the king to whom it belongs.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Magic Items</h4>\n<p>Named or not, magic items come in a variety of categories. Most items, while they have a pattern like everything in existence, do not have a True Pattern. Common magic items and Blood Charms are indeed able to create magical effects, but this is usually due to spells powering them or magical materials used in their construction. These simple enchanted items do not usually possess a True Pattern.</p>\n<p>Pattern items are items that act as bridges or links to True Patterns to which they are associated. While a pattern item does not have a True Pattern of its own, it is magical due to its special connection with the True Pattern of a significant person or place. </p>\n<p>Thread items are what most mean when they speak of magical items. These items have True Patterns that belong solely to themselves. An adept can bond with them to access their magic. Some thread items are designed and intentionally enchanted, distinguished from others by their Name, even if their magical abilities are identical. Other thread items are truly unique, and such legendary items are created by their partaking in significant deeds of powerful heroes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Threads</p>\n<p>Thread is the term used by magical scholars to describe bits of magical energy. A pattern is made up of threads, and additional threads can be woven to a pattern to strengthen it. The thread adds its magical energy to the pattern, and increases its magical power. Magicians use threads to create and power their spell patterns. Adepts use threads to unlock and power the abilities of items with True Patterns, commonly referred to as Thread Items. They weave a little bit of their own magical energy into a thread and tie it to the pattern of the item. Without the added energy and the connection provided by their thread, the adept cannot otherwise take advantage of the item’s magical power.</p>\n<p>In order to attach a thread to any True Pattern, you must know something about it—you must know one or more of the True Pattern’s key knowledges. Without this knowledge, you cannot attach a thread. For people and places, the thread is attached to a pattern item, which acts as a proxy for the True Pattern.</p>"},"_id":"EEMC9ckYSxCW5cPL","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747834276,"modifiedTime":1671747853619,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"LXflR4kKcNa47dlQ","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

But no warning from the audience can keep that character from doing what the plot demands, no matter how much trouble it lands him in.</p>\n<p>The readers and viewers can’t change the character’s behavior; we’re just along for the ride. A roleplaying game turns this situation on its ear. In a roleplaying game the players control the actions, or play the roles, of their characters and respond as they wish to the events of the plot. If the player doesn’t want his character to go through a door, the character won’t. If the player thinks his character can talk himself out of a tight situation rather than resorting to his trusty sword, he can talk away. The plot of a roleplaying game is flexible, ultimately based on the decisions the players make for their characters.</p>\n<p>In roleplaying, stories (the adventures) evolve much as they do in a movie or book, but within the flexible story line created by the gamemaster. The story outlines what might happen at certain times or in reaction to other events. The story remains an outline, with few concrete events, until the players become involved. When that happens, the adventure can become a drama as riveting as that great movie you saw last week or the book you stayed up all night to finish.</p>\n<p>Though the players all contribute to the story, creating it as they play, the gamemaster creates the overall outline and controls events. The gamemaster keeps track of what happens and when, describes events as they occur so that the players (as char- acters) can react to them, keeps track of other characters in the game (referred to as gamemaster characters), and uses the game system to resolve the players’ attempts to take action. The gamemaster describes the world as the characters see it, functioning as their eyes, ears, and other senses. Gamemastering takes both skill and practice to master, but the thrill of creating an adventure that engages the other players, tests both their gaming skills and the characters’ skills in the game world, and captures the players’ imaginations makes the gamemaster’s job worthwhile.</p>\n<p>While there are many published game supplements and adventures to aid the gamemaster, talented gamemasters always adapt the game world to suit their own and their players’ style.</p>\n<p>A roleplaying game offers its players a level of challenge and personal involvement unmatched by any other type of game. Because the players and gamemaster create the adventures they play, what happens in the course of a roleplaying game is limited only by your imagination. The game is not a contest between the players and the gamemaster, however. The gamemaster may control all the bad guys, but he should work with the players to build and experience a tense, exciting adventure.</p>"},"_id":"D3TdGelyZyMMve7X","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747834861,"modifiedTime":1671747853354,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"LY0g1opUh1cOERBQ","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Sometimes he needs to cast a spell and is unable (or unwilling) to use one of the other spellcasting methods.

In these circumstances, the magician can use the spellcasting method called grimoire casting.</p>\n<p>Casting from a grimoire is more cumbersome than matrix casting, and can expose the caster to the dangers of raw magic casting without preparation. Because of this, grimoire casting is uncommon in Barsaive. The difficulties don’t prevent a magician from grimoire casting in a crisis. For example, if the only Stop Horror Dead in its Tracks spell he has ever encountered happens to be in the ancient grimoire he just picked up from an abandoned kaer, and he’s facing the Horror to which it refers, the magician will likely attempt to cast the spell whatever the risk.</p>\n<p>A grimoire is not just a book—it contains the pattern of every spell scribed in it. Spell matrix objects (and spell matrices) were modeled on the way grimoires store spell patterns. When a magician casts a spell with a grimoire, he can channel magical energy through the spell pattern in the grimoire in much the same way he channels it through a spell matrix.</p>\n<p>To use this spellcasting method, the magician must have the grimoire in his possession and reference it in some way; a book must be open to the page with the desired spell, a rune-carved bone would need to be held in his hand so it can be read, and so on. If the magician has time to prepare the grimoire to filter the energy, he can cast the spell safely. If he is in a hurry, he exposes himself to the same dangers as raw magic casting.</p>\n<p>As with casting with raw magic, a magician is not limited to casting spells of their Circle or less when casting from a grimoire. When working with a grimoire other than their own, all tests related to preparing and casting a spell suffer a -2 penalty. This casting method differs slightly from the normal sequence for casting spells:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>(Optional) Attune the Grimoire</li>\n<li>Weave any required Spell Threads</li>\n<li>Make a Spellcasting test</li>\n<li>Determine the spell’s Effect and Duration</li>\n<li>Resolve Raw Magic Effects, if applicable</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>1. Attune the Grimoire</h4>\n<p>If a magician wants to minimize the danger and has the time to prepare, he can attune the grimoire. This process takes ten minutes, and requires a Patterncraft test against the spell’s reattunement difficulty. The attunement lasts for ten minutes per success. Essentially, the magician is using the spell pattern contained in the grimoire to act as a temporary spell matrix.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Rensil, an elf Illusionist, has been cut off from his companions by a wall that trapped him in a small closet with no apparent exit. Hoping to find a way to escape, the elf opens an old grimoire he found earlier. It contains the Walk Through spell, which might give him a chance.</em></p>\n<p><em>The air in the closet is limited, but Rensil takes some time to attune the grimoire. He makes a Patterncraft test and rolls a 19, which beats the spell’s reattunement difficulty of 16.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>If the magician does not have the time to attune the grimoire, they can still cast the spell, but will suffer as a result (see Resolve Raw Magic Effects, below).</p>\n<h4>2. Weave Spell Threads</h4>\n<p>As with normal spellcasting, the magician weaves any threads the spell requires. Rensil begins weaving the pattern of the Walk Through spell. He needs to weave one thread against a Weaving Difficulty of 11 with a –2 penalty to his Thread Weaving, since the grimoire is not his own. It takes a couple of tries, but he successfully weaves the thread.</p>\n<h4>3. Make a Spellcasting Test</h4>\n<p>After weaving the necessary spell threads, the magician makes a Spellcasting test. The air is starting to get stale as Rensil finishes weaving the thread. He makes a Spellcasting test with a -2 penalty, and successfully casts the Walk Through spell on the wall that dropped, scoring a single success.</p>\n<h4>4. Determine Effect and Duration</h4>\n<p>The effect and duration of spells cast from a grimoire are determined normally. A hole appears in the wall, and Rensil squeezes his way through as it grows and shrinks. After a minute or so of struggling, he manages to escape the trap and finds himself back in the main corridor. He gathers himself, stows the grimoire in his pack, and looks up in time to see his companions coming around the corner looking for him.</p>\n<p>If a magician is casting from his own grimoire, he gains an extra success if the spell is cast successfully. Magicians who are working at home and have the luxury of time will often cast spells from their own grimoire when preparing items for enchantment or performing magical research.</p>\n<h4>5. Resolve Raw Magic Effects</h4>\n<p>If a magician attuned the spell, there are no negative effects from casting the spell. However, if the magician was not able to attune the grimoire, the caster suffers all the effects described under Casting Raw Magic, above. If a Horror is attracted to the casting, it will sometimes mark the grimoire, allowing it to potentially spread its influence to any who study the spells the grimoire contains.</p>"},"_id":"yrrLOwfkHPkqLCN7","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747836677,"modifiedTime":1671747853725,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"NSfo7Hriync1CgcF","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

When they aren’t used for labor, they are often used for food or entertainment. Game statistics can be found in the Creatures chapter of the Gamemaster’s Guide.</p>\n<p>For long journeys, most characters prefer riding. A mount can carry them faster and farther in a single day than their own feet. Not every mount can carry a character of any race; some folk are too large or too small for certain mounts. Humans, elves and orks can ride nearly any type of mount except for the tiny kue and zoaks, which are used primarily by windlings. T’skrang can also ride just about any mount, though most prefer not to do so. Dwarfs can ride ponies, huttawas, troajin and pack mules, but their legs are too short to reach the stirrups on most horses. Trolls are too big and heavy for riding horses and smaller mounts, but war horses are strong enough to carry them. More often, trolls ride sturdy granlains or thundra beasts.</p>\n<p>Only thundra beasts and elephants are strong enough to carry obsidimen. Obsidiman characters don’t typically ride mounts—instead, they ride in wagons or carts pulled by a pair of pack mules or large draft horses. Griffins are the most exotic mounts used in Barsaive, and only high-Circle Cavalrymen or Beastmasters have the necessary skills to ride them.</p>\n<p>A Cavalryman’s starting mount, and any mounts bought from a typical dealer, come trained for riding and will generally not get spooked in combat, although temperament may vary among individuals. Untrained mounts may be purchased for 75 percent of the standard list price. Except where already noted, combat-trained mounts cost at least ten times the prices shown. Training can be accomplished with the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.talent-description.Animal Bond]{Animal Bond} and @Compendium[ed4pgpl.talent-description.Animal Training]{Animal Training} talents. Both talents are also available as skills.</p>\n<h4>Tack and Harness</h4>\n<p>To properly ride a mount, a character needs stirrups, saddle, blankets, bridles, and the like. Not having these items may cause penalties to tests made while riding at the gamemaster’s discretion. The typical price of a full set of equipment is one third the price of the mount’s list price, to a maximum of 150 silver pieces. For example, an untrained war horse normally costs 150 silver, so its saddle and other equipment cost 50 silver pieces. An elephant costs 3,000 silver, but as the maximum price for the equipment is 150 silver pieces, a character does not have to pay 1,000 silver (one third of 3,000) to equip his elephant. Availability for tack and harness is the same as for the mount.</p>\n<h4>Care and Feeding</h4>\n<p>A rider must ensure that his mount gets adequate rest, warmth and food if he wants the mount to perform well. Ideally, a mount should be rubbed down after a long day’s ride or a long gallop, given a clean stable to sleep in every night, and fed and watered each day. Characters must spend the time and money needed to care for their mounts. If they don’t, their mounts become irritable and sluggish, slow down the pace of travel and force the characters to stop frequently.</p>\n<p>Most mounts are herbivores—they eat mostly grass and hay, occasionally supplemented by high-energy grains such as oats. A few mounts, such as troajins and griffins, are carnivores. Meat usually costs more than grain, so feeding a carnivorous mount costs more than feeding a horse or a mule. Characters can allow carnivorous mounts to hunt, but a mount cannot hunt while being ridden, and most riders are understandably reluctant to let their valued mounts wander into the wilderness in search of prey.</p>\n<p>Riders usually allow their mounts to graze whenever they stop to rest, and they frequently carry an additional supply of feed to supplement the mount’s diet. Carnivorous mounts can consume preserved meat, but they prefer it fresh. When hunting or using survival skills to provide food for a band of adventurers, player characters should treat a carnivorous mount as another member of their party. For example, troajin generally eat as much meat per day as a Namegiver, while griffins require at least three times that amount.</p>\n<h4>Healing Mounts</h4>\n<p>Mounts injured in combat can be healed by the same methods used on Namegivers. However, most booster and healing potions are designed for Namegivers and may not be as effective on mounts. </p>\n<p>Characters can mix potions and herbal remedies with a mount’s feed, but this reduces the effectiveness of such medicines by half. For example, a booster potion mixed with feed works at half its normal efficacy, granting only a +4 bonus to the mount’s Recovery test. The most effective means of healing certain mounts is the Blood Share talent, which allows a mount to recover damage quickly. However, keep in mind that a character can only use these talents to heal Loyal mounts or animal servants. If a mount goes lame, its rider has a serious problem on his hands. A mount that suffers more than 3 Wounds in combat or hit by a combat spell like @Compendium[ed4pgpl.spells.Bone Shatter]{Bone Shatter}, may suffer a crippling injury to one of its limbs or wings. A lame mount cannot walk or fly until the injury heals, and even then its Movement Rate will be reduced by as much as half. Most riders simply put down lame mounts rather than spend the effort needed to heal them. Cavalrymen whose mounts go lame often perform the Rite of the Hero for their suffering mounts rather than condemn them to life as a cripple.</p>\n<table

I shudder to think what would become of</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>our world in its absence.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>•Arlax Soulbright, Illusionist •</em></p>\n<p>Magic is at the heart of the Earthdawn game. It is the source of the characters’ abilities and it is the Horrors’ path to the world. Magic is a part of everyday life in Earthdawn. It is used to light villages and towns at night, as well as to battle the remnants of the Horrors. Heroes use magic to become legends, while the Horrors and those who serve them use it to spread their corruption and evil over the world. As the history of Barsaive and the rest of the world unfolds, magic will play a central role.</p>\n<p>This chapter describes how magic came to the world, the theory behind how it works, and how characters can manipulate it to their advantage. It also describes astral space, the parallel realm from which adepts draw their magical power. The next chapters are devoted to other types of magic: spell magic, which allows characters to shape and power spells by drawing magical energy from astral space to the physical plane, and summoning, which allows characters to summon and interact with spirits and elementals.</p>\n<h3>The Cycle of Magic</h3>\n<p>The level of ambient magic in the world rises and falls over time. Sometimes it imbues the denizens of the world with magical abilities, sometimes not. The advantage of this magical cycle is that for periods of up to 5,000 years the world is magically active. Unfortunately, this high tide of magical energy enables the Horrors to cross into the physical world. At the peak of the magical cycle, the Horrors lay waste to the land in an orgy of destruction commonly known as the Scourge. Sages believe that this cresting of the magic cycle occurred at least one other time in the past, bringing an earlier Scourge. According to the few documents remaining from that time, the level of magic dropped steadily after that Scourge ended, eventually  disappearing altogether.</p>\n<p>Scholars projected that the same thing would happen during the most recent Scourge; the world’s magic level would fade, driving the Horrors back to their native astral domain. To their surprise, the Scourge ended earlier than predicted, and instead of steadily ebbing away, the magic level stopped dropping and has remained steady. </p>\n<p>The magic level has remained stable and relatively high for nearly a century. Many scholars have devoted their lives to unraveling this mystery, while others believe that the workings of magic and the universe are beyond our ken, and we shouldn’t even attempt to comprehend their deeper ways. While the debate rages on, one thing remains true: the magic level of the world has stabilized, and it is possible that this age of magic will endure for all time.</p>"},"_id":"oIoK4nKJBk2xkKqt","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747834217,"modifiedTime":1671747853601,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"PwuBzh6bJlasTmd6","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Frequently used in the days before the Scourge, blood charms remain in use in Barsaive’s burgeoning age of exploration, despite the very real cost they exact from those who wear them. All blood charms cause the wearer damage that cannot be healed until the charm is used or destroyed.</p>\n<p>Characters must attach blood charms directly to their skin; the charm breaks through the skin to reach the blood it needs to activate. Blood charm magic builds slowly. A character must wear a charm for at least one day before he can use it. Charms that may be recharged after use require the character to first heal the Blood Magic Damage taken when implanting the charm. Then the character takes Blood Magic Damage again to recharge the charm. Because the blood charm is already attuned to the character, he does not need to wait another one day before again using it.</p>\n<h4>Common Magic Items</h4>\n<p>Common magic items are those that do not require a woven thread to use. Many of these items have been created with one of the five True Elements woven into their structure, which is what gives them their varied magical properties. These properties can usually be activated or deactivated by a command word or gesture, though some are designed to react to other stimuli.</p>\n<h4>Healing Aids</h4>\n<p>Since the end of the Scourge, healing aids have boomed in popularity. Occasional shortages temporarily drive up prices. The bulk of the weight of a Healing Aid is usually its packaging, typically a clay or ceramic vial. The weight of the potion inside does not have any effect on how well it works or how much is needed: A character always requires a full dose; windlings do not need to drink less of a potion because they are smaller, trolls do not require several doses because they are larger. Unless noted in the description, healing aids that grant a Recovery test bonus do so using the rules for recovering from damage described in @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.mSo8GfCBa5CCXDm9]{Recovering from Injury}.

They have a connection to the magic of the world that makes them an above-average, often outstanding, person who lives in the world of Earthdawn. Player characters have an instinct for adventure, and the courage and personal integrity to follow that instinct. By behaving in an extraordinary fashion, player characters become the heroes others admire, trust, and depend on. They become the legends that will lead the renaissance of their world.</p>\n<h3>Building a Hero</h3>\n<p>You should now know what roleplaying in Earthdawn involves. You have a feel for the world and its races. You’ve read about another group of adventurers’ travels and encounters in the province of Barsaive. Now it is time to create your own hero and find your character’s place in this world.</p>\n<p>Each step is described in detail below, demonstrating the process at each stage by creating a sample character. Once you reach step ten, and finish filling out your Character Record Sheet, your character stands ready to become a hero.</p>\n<h4>Creating a Character</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Choose a Discipline</li>\n<li>Choose a Race</li>\n<li>Generate Attributes</li>\n<li>Determine Characteristics</li>\n<li>Record Racial Abilities</li>\n<li>Assign Talent Ranks and Spells</li>\n<li>Assign Skill Ranks</li>\n<li>Equip the Character</li>\n<li>Flesh out the Character</li>\n<li> Play the Game!</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>Getting Started</h4>\n<p>In addition to a blank Character Sheet and a pen or pencil, you will need another sheet of paper (useful for making notes as you build your character). </p>\n<p>Many decisions made when creating a character are affected by other decisions; your choice of race affects your Attributes, your choice of Discipline affects the talents available to your character, and so on. For this reason, it can be helpful to familiarize yourself with the rules in this chapter and in the@Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.fdUVLUWfZEaiyojv]{Disciplines}, @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.D8ZvvrgklfWL65QW]{Talents}, and @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.1tAED8kwJtowZD11]{Skills} chapters. It’s better to have the facts before you start, rather than be disappointed later on as a result of making uninformed choices.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>Character Sheet</h4>\n<p>As you create your character, fill in the appropriate spaces on a Actor Sheet. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>1. Choose a Discipline</h3>\n<p>The first step in creating an Earthdawn character is to choose that character’s Discipline. This is the most important decision you will make about your character, for a Discipline is much more than a character’s profession; it is a way of life. A character’s Discipline determines how he interacts with magic and how he can use magical energy to power his talents. A Discipline colors the character’s view of the world, gives him special abilities and restrictions, and defines much of what he is. The fifteen most common Earthdawn Disciplines are described in the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.9haVVmCKEUrN0Hsj]{Discipline Descriptions} chapter.</p>\n<h4>Circle</h4>\n<p>Next to the Discipline line on the Character Sheet is a notation for “Circle.” Earthdawn measures expertise in a given Discipline in Circles: the higher the character’s Circle, the more proficient (and more powerful) that character becomes. Every player character begins at First Circle—write a “1” on the Circle line of your Character Sheet. Some day, assuming things go the character’s way, he could even reach Fifteenth Circle!</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Doug is sitting down to create a new Earthdawn character. While flipping through the pages of the Player’s Guide, he is intrigued by the Swordmaster Discipline description. Doug decides his new character will be a Swordmaster. </em></p>\n<hr />\n<h3>2. Choose a Race</h3>\n<p>After selecting a Discipline, the next step is to choose your character’s race. The different races populating the world<img style=\"float:right;margin:8px\" src=\"modules/ed4pgpl/assets/pictures/standing-tskrang.jpg\" width=\"265\" height=\"677\" /> of Earthdawn are described in the@Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.UO8ktLzjYPLYa8rY]{Namegiver Races}  chapter. </p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Reading through the description of the different races, Doug thinks that the t’skrang provide interesting possibilities, and their bravado and flair for the dramatic seem a good fit for the Swordmaster. He decides his character will be a t’skrang.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h3>3. Generate Attributes</h3>\n<p>Each character in Earthdawn possesses six Attributes that define the character’s natural, unlearned physical and mental abilities. These Attributes—Dexterity, Strength, Toughness, Perception, Willpower, and Charisma—are of greater or lesser importance to different Disciplines. For example, a Thief needs a high Dexterity, which makes him faster, more coordinated, and better at performing sleight-of-hand tricks and other tasks requiring fine motor control. A Nethermancer needs a high Willpower Value, not only to make his spells more effective, but also to keep the spirits he summons in check.</p>\n<p>The following descriptions also list the various Disciplines for which that Attribute is considered important. When assigning values to Attributes, you will want to favor those Attributes especially related to your character’s Discipline.</p>\n<h4><strong><em>Dexterity (DEX)</em></strong></h4>\n<p>Dexterity measures your character’s agility, speed, and hand-eye coordination. Dexterity determines your character’s basic ability to engage in and avoid physical attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Important For: </strong>Air Sailor, Archer, Beastmaster, Cavalryman, Scout, Sky Raider, Swordmaster, Thief, Warrior</p>\n<h4><em><strong>Strength (STR)</strong></em></h4>\n<p>Strength measures a character’s muscle power. It determines the base damage inflicted by physical attacks, what weapons he can use, and how much a character can lift and carry.</p>\n<p><strong>Important For: </strong>Sky Raider, Warrior</p>\n<h4><em><strong>Toughness (TOU)</strong></em></h4>\n<p>Toughness measures a character’s endurance and general health. It gauges a character’s ability to absorb damage and keep going, as well as his natural ability to heal himself.</p>\n<p><strong>Important For:</strong> Warrior</p>\n<h4><em><strong>Perception (PER)</strong></em></h4>\n<p>Perception measures a character’s mental quickness, alertness, and ability to notice things. Perception is important to the casting of magical spells, as well as avoiding the effects of spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Important For:</strong> Archer, Cavalryman, Elementalist, Illusionist, Nethermancer, Scout, Thief, Troubadour, Weaponsmith, Wizard</p>\n<h4><em><strong>Willpower (WIL)</strong></em></h4>\n<p>Willpower measures a character’s concentration, sense of self, and determination. It helps characters resist magic and potentially damaging spells. Willpower also increases the effectiveness of spellcasting.</p>\n<p><strong>Important For:</strong> Air Sailor, Beastmaster, Elementalist, Illusionist, Nethermancer, Weaponsmith, Wizard</p>\n<h4><em><strong>Charisma (CHA)</strong></em></h4>\n<p>Charisma measures a character’s persuasiveness, social savvy, and ability to create a positive impression on others. Charisma determines a character’s success or failure at using charm, persuasion, or other social skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Important For: </strong>Air Sailor, Beastmaster, Cavalryman, Illusionist, Nethermancer, Sky Raider, Swordmaster, Thief, Troubadour, Weaponsmith, Wizard</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>Assign Attribute Points</h4>\n<p>Every character starts with the Attribute Values for his race, as outlined in @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.UO8ktLzjYPLYa8rY]{Namegiver Races}. Each player receives 25 Attribute Points which he uses to modify his character’s Attributes. The Attribute Point cost for doing so appears in the Attribute Modifier Cost Table.</p>\n<p>A player can also lower an Attribute to gain more Attribute Points, as outlined on the Additional Attribute Points Table.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Doug notes that Dexterity and Charisma are important Attributes for a Swordmaster. He decides to provide his t’skrang with high Dexterity and Charisma and checks their starting racial values. T’skrang start with Dexterity and Charisma values of 11. He adds +5 to his Dexterity and +5 to his Charisma, so that both Attributes will have values of 16. These adjustments cost 7 Attribute Points each, so Doug has spent 14 of his 25 Attribute Points. Doug wants his t’skrang to have an above average Strength and Toughness, so that his attacks will do more damage, and so he can take more damage in combat. He purchases a +4 bonus to his Strength for 5 Attribute Points, and a +3 bonus to his Toughness for 3 Attribute Points.

Determine Characteristics</h3>\n<p>A character’s Attribute values determine his characteristics. These values determine how well the character defends against various kinds of attacks, how much damage he can take before falling unconscious or dying, how much he can carry, and so on. Consult the Characteristics Table to find the value for each characteristic. </p>\n<h4>Initiative</h4>\n<p>A character’s Initiative Step determines when he acts during a combat round. The Initiative Step is equal to the character’s Dexterity Step, minus any modifiers for armor (@Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.6Mi78gLbGcTz9dyf]{Armor &amp; Shields}). Record the character’s Initiative Step on his Character Sheet, noting any modifiers on the Armor Modifiers line. Then record the character’s modified Initiative Step and dice.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>With a Dexterity Value of 16, Doug’s character has an Initiative Step of 7. He has a decent chance of acting early during combat, as long as he doesn’t weigh himself down with too much armor. Doug makes a note to keep this in mind when the time comes to purchase his equipment. For now, he marks down his base Initiative Step.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Defense Ratings</h4>\n<p>Physical Defense represents a character’s ability to avoid physical attacks. Based on the character’s Dexterity Value, it serves as the Difficulty Number an attacker must overcome when attacking a character with a sword, bow, or similar physical attack. For example, an attack made against a character with a Physical Defense of 6 is successful if the Attack test result is 6 or more.</p>\n<p>A character’s Mystic Defense represents his innate ability to avoid spells and other magical attacks. Based on the character’s Perception value, it is the Difficulty Number a magician must overcome when casting a spell or similar power against the character.</p>\n<p>Social Defense is based on a character’s Charisma value and represents a character’s chance to know when he is being lied to or manipulated by others. In this sense, a lie is an intentional deception, as opposed to a falsehood told through ignorance, and is therefore tested against the character’s ability to believe it.</p>\n<p>The dwarf to whom your character is talking may genuinely believe that he is the best hach’var player in Throal, even if he’s not; Social Defense would not help a character detect that the dwarf’s statement is false. However, if the dwarf was intentionally trying to deceive someone into believing his sporting prowess when the same dwarf didn’t believe it himself, then the character’s Social Defense would be the Difficulty Number for the dwarf’s test to make the character believe him. </p>\n<p>Some races receive special modifiers to their Defense ratings (@Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.UO8ktLzjYPLYa8rY]{Namegiver Races}). Record the character’s modified Physical, Mystic, and Social Defense Ratings on his Character Sheet.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Based on his Dexterity Value of 16, Doug’s character has a Physical Defense of 9. Mystic Defense is based on his Perception value of 12, so the Swordmaster has a Mystic Defense of 7. His Charisma Value of 16 gives him a Social Defense of 9.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Carrying Capacity</h4>\n<p>A character’s Strength value determines his ability to carry or lift weight and ultimately shows how weak or strong he really is. The Carrying Capacity is the number of pounds a character may carry without suffering a penalty for carrying too much weight.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Doug references the Characteristics Table and sees that a Strength Value of 14 allows his character to carry 140 pounds.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Health Ratings</h4>\n<p>A character’s Health Ratings are based on his Toughness Value, and determine how much damage he can take before being knocked unconscious, taking a serious wound, or dying. Health Ratings also determine how quickly a character heals. </p>\n<p>The <strong>Unconsciousness Rating</strong> is twice the character’s Toughness value, and represents the number of Damage Points required to knock the character unconscious. </p>\n<p>The <strong>Death Rating</strong> is determined by adding the character’s Toughness Step to his Unconsciousness Rating, and represents the the number of Damage Points needed to kill the character. Adept characters also add their Circle to their Death Rating.</p>\n<p>The Characteristics Table provides the values for these ratings based on the character’s Toughness.</p>\n<p>Any single attack that inflicts a number of Damage Points at least equal to a character’s <strong>Wound Threshold</strong> also inflicts a Wound. Wounds heal more slowly than normal damage and reduce the character’s ability to perform actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Recovery </strong>refers to the number of Recovery tests a character may make each day. The test is based on their Toughness Step. The result determines the amount of damage healed. Wounds impair the character’s ability to recover damage. Recovery tests can also be used to fuel some magical abilities.</p>\n<p>See @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.mTjlUrKVIDJKEVh6]{Resolving Attacks} and @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.mSo8GfCBa5CCXDm9]{Recovering from Injury} for more information on how to inflict (and recover from) damage. </p>\n<p>Some races receive special modifiers for damage and recovery (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.UO8ktLzjYPLYa8rY]{Namegiver Races}). Record the character’s Health Ratings on his Character Sheet.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Doug looks up his character’s Health Ratings on the Characteristics Table to see how much abuse his character can take before dying. With a Toughness value of 14, the t’skrang has an Unconsciousness Rating of 28, a Death Rating of 35 (34 from Toughness, +1 for First Circle), a Wound Threshold of 9, and he can make 3 Recovery tests per Day at Step 6/D10, his Toughness Step.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Armor Ratings </h4>\n<p>Physical Armor represents the physical protection the character wears or carries. Physical Armor is not listed on the Characteristics Table because it is not based on an Attribute. It helps defend against physical attacks by modifying the amount of damage the character takes from attacks. With the exception of the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.namegiver.Obsidiman]{Obsidiman} Natural Armor racial ability, a character’s Physical Armor Rating is based solely on the armor he wears.</p>\n<p>Mystic Armor helps protect the character from some magical attacks, such as spells, by immediately reducing the spell’s damage. For example, 4 points of Mystic Armor reduces the damage from many spells by –4 Damage Points per attack. The character’s Willpower value determines his natural Mystic Armor rating. Some equipment can improve this value.</p>\n<p>Record the character’s Mystic Armor rating on your Character Sheet. You may decide to simply note this rating on a separate sheet of paper until after you purchase equipment for your character, because your equipment may modify the Mystic Armor rating.</p>\n<p>Record the character’s Physical Armor Rating after you purchase armor and equipment for your character. Shields do not add to Physical or Mystic Armor ratings. Instead, they add to the character’s Physical or Mystic Defense rating, making the character harder to hit, but not directly affecting the damage taken.</p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align:center\">Mystic Armor Table</h5>\n<table style=\"width:99.9593%;height:496px\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"background-color:#95a5a6\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">\n<p>WIL Value</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">\n<p>Mystic Armor</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">3</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">4</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">5</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">6</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">7</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">8</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">9</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">10</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">11</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">12</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">13</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">14</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">15</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">16</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">17</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">18</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">19</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">20</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">21</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">22</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">23</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">24</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">25</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">26</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">27</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">28</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">29</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:45.683%;height:16px\">30</td>\n<td style=\"width:53.8777%;height:16px\">6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p>Doug figures his Swordmaster is likely to need some armor for protection, but he skips filling in his character’s Physical Armor rating until he has decided what armor he will purchase. Based on his Willpower value of 11, the t’skrang’s natural Mystic Armor rating is 2.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Movement Rate</h4>\n<p>A character’s Movement Rate determines how far he can move in combat, and is determined by the character’s race. This value allows the character to move a number of yards up to his Movement Rate each combat round (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.CqPKhNuMY200mDlo]{Combat Summary}).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Doug checks the game information for t’skrang to figure out his movement rate. His character has a Movement Rate of 12, allowing him to move up to 12 yards each combat round.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Karma</h4>\n<p>Each race has access to a different amount of Karma. This allows an adept to enhance their talents by adding an additional D6 when they spend a point of Karma on a test. Karma Points may be replenished by using the character’s Karma Ritual. A character’s Maximum Karma is determined by multiplying the character’s Karma Modifier for his race (found in @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.UO8ktLzjYPLYa8rY]{Namegiver Races}) by his Circle. If the character had leftover Attribute Points, they are added to this total. Characters start with their maximum Karma Points.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Doug notes that his t’skrang has a Karma Modifier of 4, and so will start the game with 4 Karma Points at First Circle. If he had chosen to leave his Willpower at 10 and had 1 remaining Attribute Point, his Maximum Karma Points would be 5.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h3>5. Record Racial Abilities</h3>\n<p>Every character has abilities specific to his race, such as a special type of vision or a unique attack capability. These abilities, along with detailed explanations, appear in @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.UO8ktLzjYPLYa8rY]{Namegiver Races}. Record them, along with any other racial modifications, on your Character Sheet. </p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Doug checks the racial abilities for t’skrang, and sees that his Swordmaster has the racial ability of Tail Attack. This means that his character has access to the Tail Attack combat option, which opens up some interesting tactical options for this Swordmaster</em>!</p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Assign Talent Ranks &amp; Spells</h4>\n<p>Adepts in the world of Earthdawn possess a number of magical abilities called talents. The talents available to your character are listed with your chosen Discipline. Talents are rated by Rank—the higher the Rank, the more proficient your character is. Talents usually add a Step bonus equal to the talent Rank to one of your character’s Attribute Steps to generate the final Talent Step. The @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.D8ZvvrgklfWL65QW]{Using Talents} chapter, describes all the talents and which Attribute relates to each. For example, a character with a Dexterity Step of 6 and the Melee Weapons talent at Rank 2 uses Step 8 when making a Melee Weapons test (6 + 2 = 8).</p>\n<p>There are four Disciplines which allow characters to be magicians, capable of casting spells. Magicians need to know the Patterncraft talent to learn spells, the Spellcasting and Thread Weaving talents to weave and cast spells, and one or more Spell Matrices to protect themselves from the negative effects of spell casting. The various spell matrix talents appear multiple times in the Discipline description: magicians can have more than one spell matrix active at a time. Each matrix is a separate talent that is assigned points individually. The Spell Matrix Rank determines the highest-Circle spell that the matrix can hold. For more information on spell matrices, spellcasting, and spells, see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.PwuBzh6bJlasTmd6]{The Workings of Magic}, and @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.AtxJTCL2JMY6oDIu]{Spell Magic}.</p>\n<h4>Starting Talent Ranks</h4>\n<p>Players have a total of eight points to assign to the talents their characters start the game with. Each point assigned to a talent improves the Rank by one. You may assign up to three points to a given talent, for a maximum starting Rank of 3. You may only choose talents listed as available to the First Circle of your character’s Discipline, but you do not need to put points into all of them. Record the talents you choose on the Character Sheet, adding the information for each talent given in the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.D8ZvvrgklfWL65QW]{Using Talents}chapter.</p>\n<p>With the exception of talents available to your race (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.UO8ktLzjYPLYa8rY]{Namegiver Races}), do not record talents on your character sheet that you did not assign Ranks to. If your character has no Ranks in a talent, he cannot use it, although he can improve it later using Legend Points. Talents available to your character’s race are recorded as Racial Abilities.</p>\n<p>You may also select one talent from a pool of talents available at First Circle. These talents are called Talent Options and are listed in the Discipline’s description. You do not have to choose now, you can choose the talent at a later point during the game and increase its Rank by spending Legend Points. </p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Doug’s Swordmaster is taking shape. According to the Discipline description he can have up to six talents at First Circle. For his Talent Option, he decides to take Wound Balance, as it will help him keep his feet if he gets hit in combat.  He assigns one point to each of his six First Circle talents, and then assigns one more point each to Melee Weapons and Avoid Blow to make his attacks and his active defenses a little better.</em></p>\n<p><em>In order to fill in the information for using the talents on his Character Sheet, Doug reviews the descriptions for each of his character’s talents in the @JournalEntry[</em><em>Using Talents</em><em>]{Talents chapter}.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Versatility</h4>\n<p>Human adepts automatically possess the Versatility talent at Rank 0. If you assign ranks to your character’s Versatility talent, you may acquire talents for your character from other Disciplines. You may assign Rank Points to those additional talents, but are still limited to the initial eight points available to assign to talents. Only human adepts may choose talents from Disciplines other than their own. See @Compendium[ed4pgpl.namegiver.EwXyg35MbgJAOea7]{Human}, and the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.talent-description.Versatility]{Versatility}, for more information on how this talent works. As you will discover by reading the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.tOfZBU9kPWRUh9TN]{Earning Legend Points} chapter, a character using Versatility to learn many talents from other Disciplines will advance Circles in his Discipline more slowly. Players with human characters should take this into consideration when choosing their character’s talents.</p>\n<h4>Starting Spells </h4>\n<p>Characters capable of casting spells also choose their starting spells at this time. Spellcasting characters (usually referred to as magicians) may acquire spells using a number of points equal to their Perception Step.</p>\n<p>For example, a magician with a Perception Step of 7 has seven points to acquire spells. You may only choose from those spells available to your character’s Discipline. When selecting your character’s starting spells, you may choose from First and Second Circle spells. Spells cost a number of points equal to their Circle to acquire. Note that because the character is only First Circle, he can only place First Circle spells into a spell matrix to cast safely. The character may know Second Circle spells, having written them in his grimoire, but he cannot cast them from a spell matrix until he reaches Second Circle in his Discipline. Casting them with risky raw magic or safely from his grimoire are the only options available to him (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.NSfo7Hriync1CgcF]{Casting from a Grimoire}).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Leanne is making a Wizard for her upcoming Earthdawn game. Her character has a Perception Step of 7, so she has seven points to spend on her Wizard’s starting spells. Reviewing the spells available, she selects the First Circle spells Astral Sense, Crushing Will, Flame Flash, Iron Hand, and Mind Dagger as First Circle spells, and the Second Circle spell Dodge Boost, which she will use in an emergency.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Starting Abilities</h4>\n<p>Each Discipline has one or more abilities that they start with at First Circle. All Disciplines gain Durability, a magical ability that increases their ability to take damage (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.9haVVmCKEUrN0Hsj]{Discipline Descriptions}). Some Disciplines start with a talent or skill that increases as they advance through their Discipline Circles, and magicians start with two Standard Matrices.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Doug looks at the abilities given to Swordmasters at First Circle, and sees that the only ability they are given is Durability 7. This means that he adds +7 to his Unconsciousness Rating, and +7 to his Death Rating. He notes the increased Health Ratings on his character sheet.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h3>7. Assign Skill Ranks</h3>\n<p>Players receive a number of free Ranks for Knowledge, Artisan, and Language skills. These represent areas of expertise a character cannot do without. For example, he cannot speak a language without knowing a Language skill, so characters must assign points to Language skills.</p>\n<p>The number of points available for Knowledge, Artisan, and Language skills and how they have to be spent are detailed below. In addition, the player receives an additional eight points to distribute freely among the four skill categories of Knowledge, Artisan, Language, and General skills.</p>\n<p>Each point gives a character +1 Rank in that skill, and a skill may be assigned up to three points at character creation. In contrast to talents, some skills can be used without a Rank (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.KM0xHNymNaOZ358I]{Using Skills}).</p>\n<h4>Knowledge Skills</h4>\n<p>Your character has lived in the world of Earthdawn all his life. He should know more about the world than you do as a player, and so starting characters receive two free points for Knowledge skills. These represent areas of study with which your character is familiar. Ranks in Knowledge skills add to your character’s Perception Step to determine the Skill Step. See  @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.Gi2zZbdG8lrOAjHG]{Knowledge Skills}, for a list of typical Knowledge skills.</p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align:center\">Starting Talent and Skill Summary</h5>\n<table style=\"width:99.8253%;height:112px\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"background-color:#95a5a6\">\n<td style=\"width:52.993%\">Talents/Skills</td>\n<td style=\"width:46.5676%\">Free Ranks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:52.993%;height:16px\">Talents</td>\n<td style=\"width:46.5676%;height:16px\">8 Ranks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:52.993%;height:16px\">Spells</td>\n<td style=\"width:46.5676%;height:16px\">PER Step</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:52.993%;height:16px\">Knowledge Skill</td>\n<td style=\"width:46.5676%;height:16px\">2 Ranks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:52.993%;height:16px\">Artisan Skill</td>\n<td style=\"width:46.5676%;height:16px\">1 Rank</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:52.993%;height:16px\">Speak Languae Skill</td>\n<td style=\"width:46.5676%;height:16px\">2 Ranks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:52.993%;height:16px\">Read/Write Language Skill</td>\n<td style=\"width:46.5676%;height:16px\">1 Rank</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:52.993%;height:16px\">Free Skills</td>\n<td style=\"width:46.5676%;height:16px\">8 Ranks</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Doug looks over the example Knowledge Skills, and chooses Legends and Heroes and Ancient Weapons—the t’skrang will use this knowledge to track down legendary weapons that were used by heroes of the past. He gets two Knowledge skill Ranks for free, so he assigns one point to each. </em></p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Artisan Skills</h4>\n<p>As the influence of the Horrors grew, people learned that those corrupted by the Horrors could not maintain the level of focus needed to perform precise, detailed work. Because artisans and craftsmen were among those capable of displaying such focus, many people began to learn and practice art and craft skills in order to demonstrate that they had not been corrupted by the Horrors.</p>\n<p>Performing these Artisan skills did not actually protect against the Horrors, and there is some debate about how reliable they are as a sign of Horror influence. Regardless, many consider a demonstration of these skills to provide clear, visible proof that an individual is free of Horror taint.</p>\n<p>Most people pursued fine arts, but some practiced performing arts as well, including acting, singing, dancing, and storytelling. This practice spread until, by the time the kaers and citadels began to close, nearly everyone had learned an art or craft. Adepts, whose extensive use of magic made them extremely powerful (and therefore more threatening if corrupted), took special care to become proficient with and to constantly practice an art.</p>\n<p>Starting characters receive one free point for Artisan skills. Each Discipline lists a number of Artisan skills common to adepts of that Discipline. For example, many magicians learn the art of Robe Embroidery as part of their adept training. They decorate their robes by embroidering intricate sigils and designs, finishing one, carefully picking out the stitching of an existing design, and beginning a new one in its place. Choose one of the Artisan skills from those provided in your character’s Discipline or work with your gamemaster to create one of your own. See @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.7ZxpAMm1NG8Li0J4]{Artisan Skills}, for more information. </p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>As a Swordmaster, Doug decides to give his character the Artisan skill of Storytelling at Rank 2. He decides that his character will use this skill to share stories of his adventures at roadside inns and taverns. Since he gets one Artisan skill Rank for free, he needs to spend one additional point for the second Rank.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Language Skills</h4>\n<p>In Barsaive, the Throalic dialect of the Dwarf tongue has become the common language since the dwarfs distributed the Book of Tomorrow to kaers throughout the province. It was frequently the only book in smaller kaers, and while the people of Barsaive still learned to speak their native languages, they often learned to read and write only in the Dwarf tongue. Throalic did not fall out of use after the Scourge, and today is spoken by anyone with any contact to the wider society of Barsaive. The languages of the other races are still in use, but commonly only spoken in family homes or communities made up predominantly of one race.</p>\n<p>The racial languages of Barsaive are: Dwarf, Sperethiel (the elven tongue), Human, Obsidiman, Or’zet (the orkish tongue), Troll, T’skrang, and Windling. Starting characters assign two free points to the Speak Language skill, and one free point to the Read/Write Language skill.</p>\n<p>As each Rank in the skill represents one language known, characters usually speak at least two racial languages and can read and write one racial language. As the Throalic dialect is the common tongue, characters usually choose Dwarf (Throalic) as both their written language and one of their spoken languages. They normally choose the language of their race for their second spoken language. Dwarf characters are not bound to the Throalic dialect if not hailing from Throal, and may learn to speak the language of one of the other races. At the gamemaster’s discretion, dwarf characters may assign one of their free Speak Language Ranks to a Knowledge skill.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>As a t’skrang, Doug’s character speaks both Dwarf and T’skrang, so he assigns Rank 2 to the Speak Language skill for free. He decides to leave the character’s Read/Write Language skill at Rank 1, learning Dwarf by default. Lastly, Doug notes in parentheses that his Swordmaster knows the Throalic dialect of the Dwarf tongue. He can pick up other dialects during game play.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h4>General Skills</h4>\n<p>General skills represent more practical abilities than Knowledge, Language, or Artisan skills. Many talents also have an equivalent skill in the General skills category. Most of a character’s eight additional skill points will be spent on General skills (see the@Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.1tAED8kwJtowZD11]{Skills} chapter), but they may also be spent to learn additional languages, more or improved artistic abilities, or represent more knowledge. </p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Doug must now decide where to spend his remaining skill points. He has already spent one point to bring his Storytelling skill to Rank 2, leaving him with seven points to spend. He spends two points to learn Unarmed Combat as a skill, and two points on Swimming, both of which relate to his racial traits. He then spends his remaining three points to pick up Throwing Weapons, Conversation, and the Knowledge skill T’skrang Lore all at Rank 1.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p> </p>\n<p>Starting Equipment</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adventurer’s Kit (backpack, bedroll, flint &amp; steel, torch, waterskin, large sack)</li>\n<li>Artisan Tools (relevant to character’s Artisan skill; needs gamemaster approval)</li>\n<li>Dagger or knife (or a similar Size 1 or 2 weapon)</li>\n<li>Grimoire (magicians only)</li>\n<li>Traveler’s Garb (soft boots, shirt, belt, robe or breeches, traveler’s cloak)</li>\n<li>Trail Rations (1 week)</li>\n<li>100 silver pieces</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>8. Equip Your Character</h3>\n<p>Your character needs equipment to adventure: food, clothing, armor, weapons, and more are all necessary for the character’s survival in the often dangerous life of an adept. All characters begin play with the items and equipment shown in the Starting Equipment Table.</p>\n<p>If you purchase armor or a shield for your character, fill in the Physical Armor Rating on your Character Sheet. Some types of armor and shields improve your character’s Mystic Armor as well; be sure to check the equipment description and adjust the character’s Mystic Armor Rating if necessary.</p>\n<h3>9. Flesh Out Your Character</h3>\n<p>Now you know how your character fits into the game, but what kind of person is he? The following suggestions will help you flesh out your character and create a unique individual.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4> Hidden and Surface Traits</h4>\n<p>Optional Rule: Most characters act in a manner that fits with their chosen personality traits. That is, their personality traits really describe how they act; they have few or no secrets to hide. For those players and gamemasters who want to add a little more depth to their characters, we provide the following option. </p>\n<p>Characters in Earthdawn can have two types of personality traits: surface and hidden. The surface traits are a character’s public face, what everyone but his most intimate companions sees him to be. For some characters, the surface trait is a vital part of their personality. They act and think in that manner most of the time. For other characters, however, the surface trait serves as a façade, a mask worn to conceal their real nature or their hidden traits. The character’s hidden traits should only rarely come to the surface. These traits describe the character’s true motivation, define the character’s view of the world, and determine how the character goes about achieving his long-term goals. Hidden traits will also color a character’s interaction with others.</p>\n<p>Gamemasters who decide to use this option should allow their players to give their characters at least one surface trait and one hidden trait. While multiple traits certainly create more believable characters, they create greater roleplaying challenges.</p>\n<p>The demands of certain traits may conflict with other traits. It’s hard enough being a real human being and trying to work through these conflicts without worrying about acting them out for the character, too.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Doug decides to give his t’skrang the hidden trait of proud, which gives an interesting slant to his character’s personality. His courage and tendency to help those weaker than himself is driven by a sense that he is better than others.</p>\n<p>This trait could cause him some trouble, as it is possible to push him into rash action by wounding his pride.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Roleplaying your character according to his surface and hidden personality traits may gain him additional Legend Points at the end of a story. How many your character earns depends on the story told, the circumstances, and how well he acted and reacted. If you ignore or play fast and loose with your character’s traits as the story unfolds, the gamemaster may remind you to remain true to your character’s traits. If you continue to act out of character, or expose his hidden traits, the gamemaster may award fewer Legend Points at the end of the story.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>Personality</h4>\n<p>An individual’s personality defines how that person interacts with the world. Is he stubborn? Cynical? Cunning? Spiteful? Trustworthy? Larcenous? Altruistic? Characters in Earthdawn can be defined the same way. The easiest way to define your character’s personality is to assign him some personality traits. Personality traits are descriptive labels for the way a character acts and interacts with the world.</p>\n<h4>Personality Traits</h4>\n<p>The sample traits given below (positive, neutral, and negative) can help players and gamemasters begin forming their characters’ personalities. Choose one or two traits or make up one or two of your own. Make sure your gamemaster approves them. If you later find that you want to round your character out further by adding more traits, work with your gamemaster to determine what caused your character to change. </p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Doug’s Swordmaster will be courageous and chivalrous, two personality traits that fit the character he has in mind. His t’skrang is almost a stereotype— he is always the first to charge into danger, and protects and defends those he feels need his protection.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Personality and Discipline</h4>\n<p>Your character’s Discipline can be an important element in determining his personality. As mentioned earlier, a character’s Discipline provides a framework through which the character sees the world. For example, an Archer might interpret a particular event in a completely different way than a Nethermancer or a Swordmaster. The individual Discipline descriptions provide guidelines for how characters of each Discipline interact with the world.</p>\n<p>One way to further strengthen the effect of your Discipline on your character is to select personality traits that fit with his Discipline. That is, the traits are as much a representation of the character’s Discipline as his personality. Many of the Discipline descriptions use personality traits to create the “feel” of the Discipline. For example, Cavalrymen are described as “fierce mounted warriors,” many people consider Nethermancers “eerie,” and Sky Raiders are known to be “proud.” These simple examples demonstrate how personality traits can help define characters of a given Discipline. Select one or two traits that define your character’s behavior as an adept of his Discipline, using these examples as a guide.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Swordmasters focus on perfecting their ability to fight with melee weapons, to the expense of other fighting styles. Doug decides to add “disciplined” to his personality traits, to represent his character’s focus on his chosen style.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Character History</h4>\n<p>Once you establish your character’s personality, decide what made him that way. An easy way to do that is by answering the sorts of questions authors and readers might ask about a character in a story. You may decide this information is not that important. That is certainly acceptable, but the more of these questions you answer, the better handle you will have on your character. Besides, this gives you a chance to answer these questions in ways you never would, or could, in real life. What is your character’s gender? Whether your character is male or female can make a difference. T’skrang females hold most of the political power in their communities. In dwarf, human, ork, and elven lands, power is usually distributed fairly evenly between men and women. Trolls perpetuate a male-dominated society. Obsidimen and windlings tend to think most gender roles are pretty silly. How large (or small) is your character? Are you of average size for your race? Stout? Tall? Skinny? Could anybody but another obsidiman tell a skinny obsidiman when he saw one?</p>\n<p>What color is your characters hair, eyes, and skin? The typical options are described in the Namegiver Races chapter, but they should not limit your choices. Personal appearance and style is starting to be accepted again in Barsaive. During the Scourge, conformity was important—if everyone acted and dressed in a similar way, then people could be reasonably sure that the guy with the flame-red eyes wasn’t just making a fashion statement. Life is better now; personal freedom and freedom of expression are on the rise. Of course, some guys with flame-red eyes are not doing it just to match the rubies on their dagger handles.</p>\n<p>What is your character’s general appearance? What would be someone’s first impression of your character? Does the character dress stylishly or conservatively? Does he have any distinctive marks or decorative tattoos? Does the character follow the dwarf modes of fashion or reject them for something different? Is your character attractive? Intimidating? Approachable? Does your character slouch, walk gracefully, or march as if always on patrol?</p>\n<p> Where was your character born? Your character’s race can be the determining factor for where he was born. Troll clans tend to live in mountain ranges, while elves come from forests and jungles. T’skrang are native to lakes and rivers. Many dwarfs come from the Kingdom of Throal. Humans and orks grow up nearly anywhere, as do obsidimen. Is your elf from a village or town near Blood Wood, or from a forest in the southern part of Barsaive? Is your troll a Sky Raider from the Crystal Peaks or from another mountain range? Does your character even remember where he was born? Some ork tribes roam all over the land, never staying in one place for more than two or three months. </p>\n<p>How old is your character? The Scourge ended about a hundred years ago, though some kaers stayed sealed for decades after it ended. Are you young enough that the Scourge seems like ancient history? Are you old enough to remember living in a sealed kaer or citadel?</p>\n<p>Does your character have a family? What are they like? Does he have any siblings? Are his mother and father still alive? What do they think of their child’s lifestyle? What about the rest of the family? Are they poor, middle-income, wealthy? Are they pillars of the community, or are they working to knock those pillars down? Has your character begun his own family? If not, does he want to start one? Does the rest of your character’s family want him to settle down?</p>\n<p>What are your character’s spiritual beliefs? Your character could be an atheist, but in the world of Barsaive, where the Passions walk the earth, such an attitude would seem mighty strange. Does your character worship any of the Passions? Does your character lean more toward one Passion than the others? Are there one or more Passions your character wants nothing to do with?</p>\n<p>What is your character’s moral code? Under what conditions will your character kill? Steal? Lie? Does he adhere to a personal code of ethics about violence? What about sex? Or the Horrors? Would your character ever make a deal with a Horror?</p>\n<p>Even if he was certain he could get away with it? What special qualities does your character possess? Can your character put a deal together that even dwarfs would envy? Does he have a knack for spotting unusual jewelry? Does your character see the quest through, no matter what it takes? Does he get along with members of other races?</p>\n<p> What is it your character simply cannot do? Does gold run through your character’s fingers? Does your character find it impossible to pass up a chance to get that really interesting magic item? Does your character freeze during the first moments of a romantic encounter? Does your character panic under stress? Does your character speak his mind at all the wrong times?</p>\n<p>What does your character love? Throal? Living in the Caucavic Mountains? The smell of ginger tea? Ale and good tavern talk? The bustle of a busy market? Finding just the right way to finish off a spell? A clever comment? Another person? </p>\n<p>What does your character hate? The Therans? Those stuck-up dwarfs? Nethermancers who do icky things to animals? Gate guards who ask personal questions? Kings who think they can order you around? Slow service? Assassins who just haven’t got the sense to leave you alone? </p>\n<p>What is your character’s Name? Your character’s Name is very important. In Earthdawn, the Names of people, places, and things have meaning and power. If your character often stares at others with a stern, cold look, he might be Named Ice-stare or Shiver-eyes. Was your character born with the same Name he uses now? Is his current Name a nickname? If so, who gave it to him?</p>\n<h3>10. Play the Game</h3>\n<p>Congratulations! You have completed your character. Finish filling out your CharacterSheet.

Only magical effects with an extended duration—measured in rounds, minutes, hours, days, and so on—can be dispelled. Permanent effects cannot normally be dispelled. For example, the Wood Skin talent grants an adept an increase to his Death and Unconsciousness Ratings that lasts for one or more hours.

There are two kinds of illusions: figments and true illusions. Figments are the weakest sort of illusion magic. They can interact with any senses—images, sounds, sensations and more can all be created by figments. However, figments are obviously illusory, or easily detected as an illusion; any interaction with a figment reveals its nature. They are typically used to entertain or enhance other actions. No special tests or abilities are needed to sense their status as illusions. True illusions are more powerful and effective. They do more than simply interact with a character’s senses, they directly affect the perception of anyone that interacts with them. The illusion’s pattern interacts with the affected target’s pattern, reinforcing their belief in the reality of the illusion with a degree of mental manipulation and compulsion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The more subtle the illusion, the less likely the target will suspect anything. The best illusions are ones that blend in with their surroundings, making minor modifications to the environment, or reinforcing the expectations of the target. Regardless, whenever somebody interacts with an illusion, there is a chance that they will notice the difference between their real experience and the illusory sensations enough to break the mental compulsion.</p>\n<h4>Sensing Illusions</h4>\n<p>A character may sense an illusion whenever he acts against or reacts to it. Many tests made directly against an illusion give the character a chance to notice it. If the test succeeds against the Sensing Difficulty for the illusion (as listed on the Sensing Difficulty Table), then the character notices the spell is an illusion and it no longer has any effect on that character. The character can still sense the illusion, but it no longer has any real substance, effectively becoming a figment.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Herekar the Warrior is facing off against an illusory creature guarding the entrance to an ancient shrine.

He realizes that the guardian is just an illusion as his sword passes through the wavering image in the air.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>A character who has detected an illusion can help others overcome its effects. He can use his understanding to convince others of the nature of the illusion, granting them a +5 bonus to their Sensing tests when actively working with them to demonstrate its nature.

These types of illusions are mainly damaging spells, and it will be noted in the spell description if the spell can be disbelieved. If a target chooses to disbelieve one of these spells, they will not suffer any effect from the spell. If the spell is not an illusion, however, the target’s Mystic Defense is considered to be 2 for the purpose of determining the number of successes, as they have opened themselves up to the magic. In addition, the target cannot use any  ctive defenses (such as Steel Thought) to resist the spell.</p>\n<p>Illusionists have access to spells that are both real and illusory. The target must decide if they are going to disbelieve prior to the Spellcasting test being made. No test is required—if the spell is an illusion, it simply has no effect.</p>\n<h4>Illusions and Damage</h4>\n<p>If an illusion successfully causes damage, the damage is real. The mental compulsion that accompanies a true illusion is powerful enough to cause the target’s mind to reinforce the sensations from the spell. This can manifest as burst blood vessels, muscle strain, even internal bleeding or other injuries. The only way to avoid injury from an illusion is to disbelieve the illusion at the time it is cast—a risky proposition at best.</p>\n<p>Illusions require a conscious mind. Unless the spell description specifically states otherwise, a target that is unconscious or asleep cannot be affected by an illusion. </p>\n<h4>Illusions and the Physical World</h4>\n<p>Illusions only affect the physical world to the extent that they manipulate the viewer’s perception of what is real. The best illusions restrict the opportunities for targets to sense it. Illusions are rarely tangible, and their presence reflects that.

Depending on the circumstances, the gamemaster can allow interactions like this to prompt a Sensing test, but should make the test in secret if the player or character doesn’t have reason to believe that things are not as they seem.</p>"},"_id":"gQ4CL6X9CPhadU8P","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747836775,"modifiedTime":1671747853739,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"WOvuttoVddSZgN7k","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Actions","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>During each combat round, a character can take one Standard action and any number of Simple actions. He can use Sustained actions over the course of several turns, and he can use Free actions when the ability allows it. The different types of Actions are described in more detail in the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.D8ZvvrgklfWL65QW]{Talents} chapter.</p>\n<h4>Movement</h4>\n<p>Each round, a character can freely move a distance up to his Movement Rate. If you want to move farther, you must use your Standard action. Depending on the environment (and gamemaster discretion), a character’s Movement Rate may be reduced. For example, characters fighting in knee-deep water may find their Movement Rate halved. See @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.qXeBFSr3LzTTd5zm]{Impaired Movement}, for more information.</p>\n<h4>Standard Actions</h4>\n<p><img style=\"float:left;margin-right:8px;margin-bottom:8px\" src=\"modules/ed4pgpl/assets/pictures/gentle-giant.jpg\" width=\"265\" height=\"189\" />A character can perform one Standard action per combat round. Many of the Simple and Free actions a character takes on his turn depend on the character taking a Standard action with another ability.</p>\n<p>Many talents and skills require characters to use their Standard action. A character can use only a single talent or skill that requires a Standard action during a combat round. This is because the talent or skill requires a major part of the character’s focus to execute. Talents and skills that require a Standard action usually require a test to determine their success (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.D8ZvvrgklfWL65QW]{Using Talents} and @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.1tAED8kwJtowZD11]{Skills}). This includes most combat and Interaction talents and skills, and any use of magic, including weaving threads and casting spells.</p>\n<p>A character may spend his Standard action to move, allowing him to move up to double his Movement Rate.</p>\n<h4>Sustained Actions</h4>\n<p>Not all tasks can be completed in a single round. Some talents use Sustained actions, identified by the “Action: Sustained” notation in talent or skill descriptions. A Sustained action for a talent or skill usually requires the character to spend more than one round before a test is made. Sometimes this represents days of work to craft an item or train an animal, sometimes it is an extra round or two for additional preparation or a short speech to one’s allies. Unless specified, the gamemaster should determine a reasonable length of time for the completion of such actions.</p>\n<p>Examples of actions that might require multiple rounds to complete include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Finding a specific object in a backpack (3–4 rounds)</li>\n<li>Searching an area of wall or a door (9–10 rounds)</li>\n<li>Removing or putting on a suit of leather armor (9–10 rounds)</li>\n<li>Spiking a door shut (2–3 rounds)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some Sustained actions are not covered by the rules or not listed as possibilities, because they depend too much on the situation. If a character is under pressure to complete the action quickly, the gamemaster may allow him to speed up the process by making an Action test (often an Attribute test) at the end of each round to determine success. This usually prevents the character from taking any other actions during the round.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Ulm wants to retrieve a key he found to lock a door behind his group as they flee a nasty Horror construct. Unfortunately, he stowed the key in his backpack, along with his other adventuring gear. The gamemaster decides it will take Ulm three rounds to retrieve the key. He would really like to find it sooner.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Simple Actions</h4>\n<p>Apart from his Standard Action, a character can perform a variety of Simple actions during a combat round, which may or may not require him to make a test. Some talents and skills do not require a Standard action to use; these are often considered Simple Actions, and include talents or skills such as Anticipate Blow, Astral Sight, Battle Shout, or Second Attack.</p>\n<p>Technically, there is no limit to the number of Simple actions a character can perform during a combat round. However, the gamemaster may choose to limit what a character can reasonably do during a (roughly) six-second time period, balanced against the fact that Earthdawn is a fantasy game, and limiting actions should serve the goal of telling an exciting story. Here are some examples of Simple Actions that</p>\n<p>could reasonably be carried out during a single combat round:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Speak a short sentence (a dozen words or so)</li>\n<li>Draw or sheath a melee weapon</li>\n<li>Unsling a shield or take off a backpack</li>\n<li>Put an item into or take one out of a belt pouch</li>\n<li>Quickly search an area of wall or a door</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Free Actions</h4>\n<p>Free actions are usually part of other actions a character takes, enhancing them. There are no activities that are Free actions on their own, and as such there is no list of example Free actions as there is for other action types. Most Free actions are either enhancing the outcome of another Simple or Standard action (such as increasing damage), or they are a reaction to another character’s action, such as dodging an attack. As a rule of thumb, only one defensive talent or skill can be used against a single attack. For example, it isn’t possible to use the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.talent-description.CuvgDYlneMz2KmhB]{Uniknięcie trafienia} and @Compendium[ed4pgpl.talent-description.YEPF4FYBl73Ydxxw]{Riposte} talents against the same attack.</p>\n<h4>Resolving Actions</h4>\n<p>Starting with the highest Initiative test result, characters perform their declared actions, one at a time, until all characters’ actions have been resolved. The gamemaster counts down Initiative values, starting with the highest result. Each character takes his turn performing actions. Characters often make Attack tests when engaged in combat, but an action might also consist of casting a spell, running, or using a non-combat talent while the arrows and spells fly. The character makes the appropriate test, announcing the result after rolling the appropriate dice, including any Karma or bonus dice rolls.</p>\n<p>Each character’s actions are resolved before the next character acts, unless the description for the talent or skill being used specifically states otherwise.</p>\n<h4>Reserved Actions</h4>\n<p>Instead of acting on his Initiative, a character may choose to wait until later that round for a more appropriate moment to act. This is referred to as reserving an action. Reserving an action allows a character to react to other events, perhaps even preventing them. When reserving an action, the character specifies an event and has the right to act at any later point during the round when that event occurs, interrupting the character whose turn it is.</p>\n<p>When resolving his reserved action, the character who reserved his action goes first. The concentration required while waiting for the right moment increases the difficulty of the action performed. Characters taking a reserved action add +2 to the Difficulty Number of all actions performed on their turn.</p>\n<p>Taking a Reserved Action is often the only way a character can attack opponents making @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.H9SepRjoJykVMFHR]{Charge Attacks} or @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.E5X97Bbqp6vWPoRP]{Swooping Attacks}.</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<h4> </h4>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Herekar is looking out for his friend Tairin during a fight with five cadaver men. Herekar has the highest Initiative result with a 14, and declares a reserved action— saying he wants to intercept anyone who tries to attack Tairin.</em></p>\n<p><em>One of the cadaver men, with an Initiative of 8, moves to attack Tairin. Herekar decides to jump in. He attacks the cadaver man, adding +2 to the undead’s Physical Defense. His attack knocks the cadaver man down.</em></p>\n<p><em>The cadaver man then takes his turn. He can try to attack Tairin from the ground, or do something else.”</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4 style=\"font-style:italic\">Talent and Ability Interactions with Delayed and Reserved Actions</h4>\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\">Some talents and abilities require a character to have a higher Initiative than his opponent. These abilities may only be used if a character’s Initiative test result is higher than his opponent’s. If a character chooses to delay or reserve his action, it does not retroactively trigger other character’s abilities that require a higher initiative - the Initiative test result does not actually change.</p>\n<hr style=\"font-style:italic\" />\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\">Herekar the Warrior uses Cobra Strike to try and gain an advantage against Kira the Thief. Kira ends up with a higher Initiative test result, and so Herekar does not gain the Attack test bonus the talent provides.”</p>\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\">If Kira decides to delay her action and act after Herekar, he still does not gain the test bonus from Cobra Strike, even though he is now taking his action before the Thief.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Delayed Actions</h4>\n<p>Instead of acting on his Initiative, a character may simply choose to act later in the round. This is referred to as delaying an action. When delaying an action, the character may act at any time later in the round, and does not suffer any penalties.</p>\n<p>However, the character cannot interrupt another character’s action simply by delaying his own action.</p>\n<p>If he does not act during the current round, a character may delay his action into the following round. His Initiative for the next round is automatically 1 higher than the highest Initiative rolled for the new round. If he chooses to roll his Initiative normally, he loses his delayed action.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Maloren is first to act during a round. He intends to cast the Flame Weapon spell on one of his companions, but wants to see which one will find himself on the front line. He decides to delay his action. Later on Initiative count 6, Maloren sees that his friend Herekar has moved in to fight off the cadaver men. Maloren decides Herekar will benefit the most from the Flame Weapon spell, so after Herekar has has resolved his action, Maloren steps in and casts the spell. </em></p>\n<hr />\n<p> </p>"},"_id":"vPvtLw9aFlGoztgn","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747832948,"modifiedTime":1671747853797,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"YlJzZ4afr5ggqdqz","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Talents","color":"#d6b305"}},"pages":[{"name":"02. Game Terms","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>The talent descriptions describe how to use each talent. The text also describes the effects of the talent, and boldface entries above each description summarize important game information. This information falls into the following categories. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Step Number</h3>\n<p>The Talent Step is usually determined by adding the adept’s Talent Rank to the Attribute Step listed under the “Step:” notation. If the talent requires the adept to make a Talent test, the Step Number is used to determine the dice the player rolls.</p>\n<p>For example, an adept with a Perception Step of 6 and the Spellcasting talent at Rank 3 would have a Spellcasting Step of 9 (6 + 3 = 9). </p>\n<p>The Step/Dice Table shows that Step 9 uses D8+D6. Some talents use only a Talent Rank—no Attribute Step is added to the Talent Rank in this case. Some talents do not require a test—their effect is determined differently, as detailed in the talent description.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Action</h3>\n<p>Certain talents require an adept to perform different types of Actions. Different types of Actions indicate varying types of effort the adept has to put into using that talent (and many other abilities). The type of Action required to use a talent is indicated in the “Action:” notation in the talent’s characteristics. A talent requires the indicated Action every time it is used, which normally means every time a test is made. There are five types of Actions: Standard, Simple, Free, Sustained, and NA (Not Applicable).</p>\n<p>Standard Actions require most of the adept’s attention or govern much of what he can do in one combat round. An adept can use only one Standard action per combat round. Note that some talents explicitly allow several tests be made as part of using that Talent. For example, adepts with the Claw Frenzy talent can make several Attack tests as part of using the talent, because the rules for that talent allow it.</p>\n<p>Simple Actions require little effort. There is normally no restriction to the number of Simple Actions an adept can perform, but some groups may want to limit the number of Simple Actions available in one combat round. Simple Actions differ from Free Actions (see below) in that they are usually independent from other Actions the adept makes, but often indicate some sort of obvious activity, such as speaking, moving, or making gestures. Unless noted otherwise, a character may only attempt a given talent once per round.</p>\n<p>Free Actions, like Simple Actions, are not limited, but are not usually independent from other Actions. They are typically used as part of an adept’s general defensive or enhancement abilities. For example, using a talent that enhances Damage Tests is often a Free Action, resulting from the initial attack that used a Standard or Simple Action. Except where otherwise noted, Free Actions are usually not indicated by any special visible effects, but may intensify an existing visible effect. For example, all characters continuously dodge and evade in combat, which is represented by their Physical Defense. An adept using Avoid Blow to dodge attacks might look as if he did so with more effort than normal.</p>\n<p>Free Actions are normally the only type of Action an adept can use when it is not his turn—they are often reactions to other Actions in this capacity. As with Simple Actions, a character may only attempt a given talent once per round.</p>\n<p>Sustained Actions take more than one round to perform, and use the adept’s Standard Actions over the course of several consecutive rounds, minutes, or hours, as indicated in the talent description. They usually apply more special rules to how they are used than other talents, or require the player and gamemaster to determine how many Standard Actions are used. Sustained Actions often require complicated activities before they can be used, and these may differ from use to use. While some talents might require efforts over multiple rounds, they are only Sustained Actions if they actually require a Standard Action to be used several times in a row before the talent takes effect. For example, the Book Memory talent requires a Standard Action, despite the adept only being able to memorize a specific number of pages per minute, but the memorization takes place after the Book Memory test is made. The Forge talent, on the other hand, requires the adept to work on a weapon for some time before making the Forge Weapon test, and therefore uses a Sustained Action. Some talent Actions are shown as NA or Not Applicable. These talents do not use Actions—they are usually active all of the time and typically do not use Talent tests.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Strain</h3>\n<p>Talents that cause Strain drain small amounts of an adept’s life energy to fuel their use. The “Strain:” notation shows the number of Damage Points the adept takes each time he uses the talent. An adept always takes full, unmodified damage from Strain—no armor provides protection—and may take Strain damage multiple times from a single talent during a round. Unless specified, Strain never causes Wounds. </p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Girr, a windling Beastmaster, knows the Claw Frenzy talent at Rank 3. She may make up to three attacks per round using this talent. Claw Frenzy has a Strain cost of 1. If Girr uses Claw Frenzy to make three attacks, she would take 3 Strain damage.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3>Skill Use</h3>\n<p>Many talents can be learned as skills, that is, as the mundane version of the same ability. If a character can learn a given talent as a skill, then this entry will show Yes. Learning skills is harder, takes longer, and costs more, but does allow a character to use a talent without magic. This is the most common way for characters to learn talents that are not available to their Discipline.</p>\n<p>If the talent can be learned as a skill, this entry will also indicate a tier cost in parentheses, for example (Journeyman). This refers to the Legend Point cost to increase the skill version of the talent. See @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.cQzedYByq8oQcns3]{Improving Skill Ranks}, for more information on learning and increasing skills.</p>\n<p>Sometimes there are differences between the magical and non-magical versions of a talent.

Talents for Casting Spells","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>A magician uses the Spellcasting and Thread Weaving talents to power a spell by shaping its pattern and casting it. The magician also needs a spell matrix talent, or one of the variants, to provide a safe conduit for transferring magical energy from astral space to the physical world. As a magician gains experience, he learns to channel more magical energy into his spells and can use the Willforce talent to increase their power. The information below summarizes these basic spellcasting talents. Full descriptions can be found in the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.D8ZvvrgklfWL65QW]{Talents} chapter.</p>\n<h4>Spellcasting Talent</h4>\n<p>Each of the four magician Disciplines—Elementalist, Illusionist, Nethermancer, and Wizard—have the Spellcasting talent available to them. This talent allows them to channel magical energies to create a spell. Spellcasting ranks are added to a character’s Perception Step to make Spellcasting tests, so a character created with a high Perception value begins with an advantage as a magician.</p>\n<p>When casting a spell, the magician makes a Spellcasting test against a Difficulty Number, usually called the Casting Difficulty. Often this is the target’s Mystic Defense, though in some cases another value is used. Each spell description lists the Casting Difficulty for that spell. If the result of the Spellcasting test is at least equal to the Difficulty Number, the spell succeeds. If the spellcaster achieves extra successes, the spell will have additional effects depending on the spell.</p>\n<h4>Thread Weaving Talent</h4>\n<p>Each magician Discipline has its own Thread Weaving talent: Elementalism, Illusionism, Nethermancy, and Wizardry. The Thread Weaving talent allows a magician to weave spell threads into a spell’s pattern. A magician also uses Thread Weaving to place spell patterns into a spell matrix. A magician may only cast or learn spells if he knows the Thread Weaving talent for that Discipline.</p>\n<p>Each Thread Weaving talent is unique, and can only be used with spells from that Discipline. If a magician purchases the Thread Weaving talent from another Discipline, he can cast and learn spells from that Discipline.</p>\n<h4>Spell Matrices</h4>\n<p>In the early days of this magical age, magicians worked their spells with raw magic, channeling astral energy directly through their own patterns and shaping that energy into spells. In the years leading up to the Scourge, however, magicians discovered that these spellcasting techniques created flares in astral space that could attract the attention of nearby Horrors. As a result, the very spells magicians used could bring about their destruction. Many magicians died terrible deaths before the phenomenon was understood and a countermeasure devised. </p>\n<p>Magicians needed a means to conceal the flares caused by forming spells from raw magic. They also needed a way to filter the increasingly corrupted astral energy and ensure that their spells would function properly. Magicians reasoned that this filter would need to be a magical pattern that came between the magician and astral space, providing concealment and protection.</p>\n<p>Several magicians discovered they could produce such filters by using their Thread Weaving talents to alter the patterns of physical objects. Magicians most commonly used items they carried with them, such as staves, rings, wands and their ever present robes. By “reweaving” these items with magical spell patterns, these items could be used to hold the essential matrix of one or more spells. The magician could then use the item to cast the spell without fearing the attention of the Horrors or risking harm from polluted astral energy. This system worked well enough, but if these matrix objects were lost or destroyed, a magician could be left with no safe means of casting spells.</p>\n<p>Not long after the end of the Scourge, Nethermancer adepts discovered a way to create a filter purely from magical threads woven to the magician’s True Pattern. The magician could then use his Thread Weaving talent to “attune” the filter to mimic the pattern of any spell he wished to store. This technique quickly developed into the spell matrix talents now used by magicians all over Barsaive and the Theran Empire. With these portable, personal and flexible matrices, the use of “magician’s robes” and other matrix items fell into disuse.</p>\n<p>Once a spell has been placed in a spell matrix, the magician can repeatedly cast the spell by drawing magical energy through the matrix. If the magician wishes to cast a different spell using the same matrix, it must be attuned to reflect the new spell. Magicians can have multiple spell matrices, attuned as they wish, depending on their personal abilities.</p>\n<p>Some spells are too complex for a simple spell matrix. When a spell matrix is attuned to reflect more complex spells, the mimic-pattern of the matrix is compressed into a kind of shorthand. This compression allows the matrix to reflect most of the complex spell’s pattern, but the magician must weave additional threads of power into the matrix, based on the complexity of the spell. These threads power the matrix and temporarily expand its capabilities so the spell can be properly cast. Once the spell is cast, the matrix returns to its compressed state. Each time the magician casts that spell, he must weave the required threads again to provide the power for the spell.</p>\n<p>In the world of Earthdawn, magicians rarely cast spells without first placing them in a spell matrix. The other methods of casting a spell, casting from a grimoire, or casting raw magic, are either slower and more difficult, or dangerous and unreliable. The use of spell matrices comes with a few drawbacks. The matrix rank represents the maximum Spell Circle the individual matrix can hold. The magician must also have a strong enough pattern to attune the matrix, represented by the highest Discipline Circle he has achieved. Even though learned spells become part of the magician’s pattern, he may not be able to attune these more powerful spells into the matrix, regardless of the rank of the matrix. For example, a Rank 3 Spell Matrix can hold a single First, Second, or Third Circle spell. However, a Second Circle magician is not able to attune a Third Circle spell—he must resort to using raw magic or a grimoire to cast it.</p>\n<p>More details about the different types of spell matrices and how they are used in the game is provided later in this chapter.</p>\n<h4>Willforce Talent</h4>\n<p>The Willforce talent provides additional energy to increase a spell’s effect. Magicians do not normally have access to the Willforce talent until they reach higher Circles in their Discipline. Until a magician learns the Willforce talent his spell effects are based solely on his Willpower Step.</p>"},"_id":"XF5TSsSAzV3k6Jc7","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747836374,"modifiedTime":1671747853674,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"cxW3nQkUABRIyR9e","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

The character makes an Astral Sensing (6) test—the Mystic Defense of astral space. This base difficulty is modified by the classification of astral space, as shown in the Astral Sensing Table. If the test succeeds, the character senses the astral imprint of everything within the range of the astral sensing ability being used. The character can tell whether the imprint is a magical or mundane object, and can also determine the classification of astral space. If the test fails to beat the modified target number, but still exceeds the base Difficulty Number of 6, the character knows that the failure was because of astral interference or corruption.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>While searching the study of a merchant he suspects of being behind a Horror cult, the Wizard Tomas finds a lockbox under a false panel in the wall. Tomas decides to use astral sensing to check for any magical traps protecting the box. The gamemaster has decided that the building is in open astral space, so the Difficulty Number for astral sensing tests is 8 (6+2). The player makes an Astral Sight test with a result of 13—two successes against the modified Difficulty Number. Tomas successfully perceives astral space and the imprint of the lockbox. He also notices that there is not much corruption—astral space here is “open.” There are no magical imprints on the box, so he is fairly certain there isn’t a magical trap protecting it.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Unless specifically indicated by the particular ability, astral sensing does not enable an adept to detect the imprints or patterns of subjects hidden behind or within other objects.</p>\n<h4>Patterns in Astral Space</h4>\n<p>Adepts may encounter several types of magical patterns during their adventures. Living creatures such as Namegivers and Horrors, magical items, and spells and other magical abilities (including dragon or Horror powers) all possess different types of patterns. Each type of pattern appears slightly different from the others, just as each individual pattern differs from others of the same type.</p>\n<p>When viewed astrally, the pattern of any living subject—adept, creature, or non-adept Namegiver—appears in the subject’s astral imprint. The imprint is roughly the same size and shape as the subject. A subject’s pattern, however is much more complex and provides much more information about the subject. For example, an adept’s astral imprint is the same size and shape as the adept, has a glowing presence that swirls around the imprint, but provides no other information. On the other hand, the adept’s pattern might show the adept’s Discipline, threads woven to the adept’s pattern, and signs of injury or blood magic use.</p>\n<p>While the patterns of most Namegivers and creatures occupy the entire astral imprint of their subjects, the pattern of a magical item may occupy only a portion of its imprint. This usually results from the method used to enchant the item. For example. the astral imprint of a magical sword will be shaped like a sword, but its pattern may only occupy the hilt.</p>\n<p>Spells and other magical abilities produce the most unusual type of patterns. (The term “magical abilities” includes talents, dragon and Horror powers, and unusual magical effects such as the corruption of the Blood Wood or the existence of life within the Poison Forest.) Patterns produced by these magical abilities typically resemble clouds of magical energy that represent the spell or ability’s effect and cover its area of effect. For example, a Chilling Circle spell might appear as an icy cloud of astral energy radiating out from the magician who cast the spell. A Mind Dagger spell might appear as a dagger-shaped bolt of astral energy that flies from the caster to his target.</p>\n<p>While astral sensing allows adepts to view the patterns of spells and magical effects used during combat, most adepts use it to detect and study the patterns of extended-duration spell effects, such as those produced by magical traps or wards. These patterns usually appear as small pockets of astral energy. Close examination of such a pattern may reveal its effect, the type of spell, its Circle, or even clues about the magician who cast the spell.</p>\n<p>When using an astral sensing ability to study the pattern of a spell, the adept makes an Astral Sensing Test against the spell’s Mystic Defense, which is the same as the spell’s Dispel Difficulty.</p>\n<p>The gamemaster determines the specific details of a subject’s pattern, based on the subject’s nature. He also determines what information a character can learn from studying a subject’s pattern, based on the result of the Astral Sensing test.</p>\n<h4>Astral Sensing Methods</h4>\n<p>To illustrate the differences between the two main astral sensing methods— the Astral Sight talent and Thread Sight—the following sections include examples of an adept using the method to examine a magical item: a silver torc set with three large semi-precious stones. The stones are held in place with orichalcum wire, and the stones themselves are infused with True elements. It was crafted by an Elementalist, with elemental spirits helping with the enchantment process. The torc has a Mystic Defense of 15.</p>\n<h4>Astral Sight Talent</h4>\n<p>The Astral Sight talent allows characters to look into astral space and directly view astral imprints and patterns. This is perhaps the best overall method of astral sensing available in Earthdawn. Because Astral Sight is a talent, a character can improve the ability over time, allowing the adept to view the patterns of subjects with high Mystic Defense ratings and detect considerable detail in a pattern. Of course, Astral Sight is not without drawbacks. The character takes 1 Strain each time he uses the talent, with the effect only lasting for a relatively short time. As such, extended examinations of magical patterns can be taxing. After detecting a pattern, an adept can make subsequent Astral Sight tests to see more detail. These tests do not cause the character additional Strain if they are performed during the talent’s duration.</p>\n<p>When the duration expires, or if any of the subsequent tests fail to equal or exceed the subject’s Mystic Defense, the character loses sight of the pattern and must make a new Astral Sight Test to continue examining the pattern, taking 1 Strain. </p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>When he first looks at the torc with Astral Sight, Maloren sees the orichalcum wire woven around the elemental stones and determines that they contain the item’s pattern. Maloren makes another Astral Sight test to study the pattern. The test yields a result of 21, two successes against the torc’s Mystic Defense. Maloren sees a chain of interlocking waves that flows from one end of the pattern to the other, looping around brighter spots that match up with the enchanted stones. The stones are different colors and patterns, based on the element infused into it. One shows dozens of birds swirling around a vortex of air, the second has a swirling mass of boulders, while the third has flaming sprites flitting back and forth through a bonfire in a complex dance.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Thread Sight</h4>\n<p>Adepts receive Thread Sight along with the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.talent-description.ifnChL8TirB09m6U]{Thread Weaving Talent}. Characters use Thread Sight to see the pattern of an item in order to weave threads to it. Thread Sight gives the user a mental picture of the pattern, but with less precision. Thread Sight does not allow an adept to see detail or glean information from a pattern. It simply allows an adept to sense enough of the pattern to weave threads to it. Using Thread Sight in this manner does not require a separate test—it takes place as part of the adept’s Thread Weaving test. Thread Sight cannot be used to sense the magical patterns of creatures, Namegivers, or other magical auras.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Maloren decides to weave a Rank 1 thread to the torc’s pattern. He has already learned the required Key Knowledge, so he makes a Thread Weaving test against the thread’s Weaving Difficulty. As he does so, an image of the torc’s pattern forms in his mind. Using his Thread Sight, Maloren sees the pattern’s simple blue knotwork, twisting around three glowing orbs of silver white, ruddy brown, and orange-red.</p>\n<hr />\n<p> </p>"},"_id":"LXHdncoBY4U6aJ0B","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747834249,"modifiedTime":1671747853612,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"hJJQtithyhFwR4Ti","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Astral space is a limitless region that coexists with the physical world, but on a different plane. The astral and physical worlds are intricately connected and interdependent; neither could exist without the other. The biggest difference between the way our world looks to us and the way it appears astrally is that, when viewed from astral space, we perceive the glow emanating from all living beings—a glow that represents their life energy. Living beings include not only people and animals, but also plant life, elemental air, earth, fire, water, and wood, and the living stone of the earth itself. While the dimension of astral space mirrors the physical world, the astral realm also functions as a world unto itself, subject to its own laws of reality. As a result of this dual nature, astral space remains a source of much conjecture and speculation among even the most knowledgeable scholars and magicians across Barsaive and the Theran Empire.</p>\n<p>Astral space is the cosmic fabric that binds together all worlds, and the medium through which magical energy travels. Whether astral space is the source of magical energy or simply a conduit for it is one of the countless mysteries that the astral realm continues to hold. </p>\n<p>The people and creatures who use magic do so by drawing energy from astral space into the physical world. In order to do this, they must be able to perceive astral space. Only through astral perception can magical energy be manipulated, as magical energy is only visible in astral space. All the magical talents available to characters in Earthdawn allow adepts to perceive the magical energy necessary to perform them. </p>\n<h4>The Nature of Astral Space</h4>\n<p>Astral space has no native landscape of its own. It has no ground or sky, and no source of illumination such as the sun. Without ties to the physical world, astral space appears as a limitless void of inky black. It contains nothing to see, nothing to hear, nothing to feel. Any being within this void would be lost in an ocean of darkness. The connection between the astral and physical worlds, however, provides the astral realm with features that mirror the physical realm. Locations in astral space correspond with some physical location, because everything in the physical world possesses an astral imprint that reflects the physical object’s pattern. In a sense, astral space is like a mirror held up to the physical world, reflecting its magical nature. Though astral space does contain some apparently featureless areas where the void— known as the deep astral or high astral—seem to exist, these areas are simply the astral imprints of extremely bleak physical locations.</p>\n<p>During the time known as the Scourge, the Horrors roamed the physical world, leaving it ravaged and scarred, populated by twisted creatures, and a pale reflection of its former splendor. Because the astral world is a reflection of the physical world, the harm the Horrors did to the physical world is reflected in astral space. Indeed, the Horrors damaged the fabric of astral space itself.</p>\n<p>While every living thing and inanimate object that exists possesses an astral counterpart, astral space contains objects and living things that only exist within astral space, with no physical counterpart. Indeed, some parts of astral space—specifically the various realms known collectively as the netherworlds—seem to exist outside the standard astral/physical continuum.</p>\n<h4>The Astral Landscape</h4>\n<p>On viewing or entering astral space, an explorer sees the astral imprints of all the people, physical objects, and creatures that lie within their sight. In addition, they see astral creatures, such as spirits and Horrors, and any other astral patterns. These astral imprints, creatures, and patterns comprise the astral landscape. The nature of the astral landscape precludes physical beings (including Namegivers) from using their senses of smell, taste, and touch.</p>\n<p>Another feature of the astral landscape is the ever-present tufts and swirls of astral energy and the magical corruption left by the Horrors. Astral energy rarely impedes a person’s movement or perception. It usually appears as lightly shimmering wisps eddying in and around everything. When a magician casts a spell, they gather some of this energy, form a pattern and unleash it to generate the spell’s effect.</p>\n<p>In contrast, the magical corruption left by the Horrors may seriously affect astral explorers. This pollution may obscure a person’s vision and perception, cause him damage and impede his magical abilities.</p>\n<h4>Astral and Physical Forms</h4>\n<p>All living things and inanimate objects exist in either astral or physical form. A subject’s place of origin (physical world or astral plane) usually determines whether it possesses a physical or astral form. Normally, physical beings cannot directly affect or interact with objects or beings in astral space, though some spells and magical powers may allow them to do so. Likewise, astral beings cannot normally interact with things in the physical world without the use of magic spells or powers. Because Namegivers rarely enter astral space, most everything and everyone characters are likely to encounter in Earthdawn possess physical forms. </p>\n<p>The forms of creatures and objects can be changed from astral to physical or from physical to astral. When a character from the physical world enters astral space, his physical form merges with his astral imprint to create an astral form. When the character returns to the physical world, he reverts to his physical form. This means that physical objects can be taken into astral space, and creatures from astral space can enter the physical world. This also means that physical objects and beings can be left in astral space (perhaps the perfect hiding place), and astral objects or beings can be trapped in the physical world.</p>\n<p>Subjects are usually identified by their current forms. The term physical being is used to denote both naturally physical beings such as Namegivers as well as astral creatures—like spirits—that have manifested physical forms. Likewise, the term astral beings is used to denote native denizens of astral space as well as Namegivers that have assumed astral forms. </p>\n<p>The only exception are the dual-natured Horrors, which exist in both physical and astral forms simultaneously. In many cases the physical and astral bodies of a dual- natured Horror can work independently of one another, though most are connected in some way. This nature makes these entities extremely powerful and especially difficult to kill; most of them can create new physical bodies to replace ones that have been destroyed, or create new astral forms by simply entering astral space.</p>\n<h3>Astral Imprints</h3>\n<p>There are two general types of astral imprints: those of inanimate objects, and those of living beings and magical items. The magical energy of living beings and magical items provide their astral imprints with considerably more substance than those of inanimate objects. Inanimate astral imprints possess form but little substance. The astral imprint of a book can be seen, but the pages of the imprint cannot be turned. An adept may look through the astral imprint of a window, but not the imprints of opaque physical objects.</p>\n<p>The astral imprints of walls, dead trees, or any non-magical objects created by Namegivers appear nearly identical to their physical counterparts. Though an astral imprint resembles the physical object that produces it, most astral imprints appear nearly colorless and tend to blend into a dull mass when viewed by a casual observer, especially when they are far away.</p>\n<p>Because the astral imprints of inanimate physical objects are insubstantial, astral beings (including Namegivers in astral space) can pass through them. The sensation of passing through the astral imprint of what the character recognizes as solid matter is disconcerting and confusing. Most Namegivers in astral space prefer to walk around imprints of obstacles rather than through them. To reflect this  isorientation, any Namegiver who passes through an astral imprint of solid matter suffers a –2 penalty to all Action Tests he makes within two minutes of passing through the imprint. Spirits, Horrors, and other native astral entities do not suffer this penalty. </p>\n<p>In contrast to the dull, insubstantial imprints of inanimate objects, the astral imprints of living things, such as plants, animals, and Namegivers, display a distinctive aura. These auras glow with an ethereal nature and give living imprints a vivid appearance. Namegivers display particularly strong auras because of the intricate detail of their True Patterns. The world is also a living entity, and produces an aura that gives most of astral space the appearance of twilight. This light is visible in almost all areas of astral space, except in areas completely enclosed by the astral imprints of inanimate matter.</p>\n<p>The imprints of living things also possess substance. Since they are “solid,” astral beings cannot pass through them. Because the earth has a living imprint, astral beings cannot penetrate through ground level in astral space.</p>\n<p>They may pass through the imprints of freestanding rocks or cobblestone roads, and may even venture below ground through caves, tunnels, or mine shafts where the living earth has been removed, but the imprint of the earth itself blocks their passage. This was one of the main reasons that so many kaers were built below ground; the surrounding earth created a solid imprint that served as a barrier in astral space. These astral barriers saved hundreds of thousands of Namegivers from the Horrors even during the worst of the Scourge.</p>\n<p>Magical items and spells also produce vibrant, “living” astral imprints. All magical items are created by directly investing them with magical energy, and so they create astral imprints with auras and substance. Spells reflect living astral imprints because they are created from magical energy. Most spell imprints take on shapes that reflect their function. Pattern items likewise possess living imprints, because they contain aspects of their related True Pattern and are invested with magical energy.</p>\n<p>Astral imprints make it relatively easy to determine whether an item is “magical”— if it displays a living aura, it is magical. The aura does not usually give any clue as to the nature of that magic, only that magic is present in some form. To learn about the nature of the magic, one must study its pattern, and that requires specialized magic.</p>\n<h4>True to Form</h4>\n<p>A living thing’s astral imprint reflects its pattern, and so the astral imprint resembles the thing’s truest form. While they have no effect on a living being’s pattern, illusory spells or abilities mask both the being’s physical form and astral imprint until Sensed or Disbelieved (see@Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.WOvuttoVddSZgN7k]{Illusions}) or their effect expires.</p>\n<p>Generally, only two situations produce discrepancies between the physical appearance and the astral imprint of a living being. The first is a radical change in the being’s physical form, such as the loss of a limb. In such cases, the astral imprint will simultaneously reflect the change and the being’s original appearance. For example, the imprint might retain an ethereal, ghostlike vestige of the amputated limb.</p>\n<p>The second situation occurs when a thing or being’s pattern is directly altered. In this case, the subject’s astral imprint and its physical appearance would reflect the change in its pattern.</p>\n<p>In such a scenario, the being’s astral imprint would become a blurred combination of the altered and original imprint, forcing any viewer to focus on one or the other. Altering the pattern of a living thing in this way requires extremely powerful magic. The astral imprint of a living being’s pattern often offers clues to the nature of the person. The more magic a person uses, the more complex his pattern, and the more significant his astral imprint will be. The astral imprint of a farmer who uses magic to increase his yields and care for his land will be more complex than the pattern of a merchant who uses no magic at all. The pattern of a multiple-Discipline adept will show greater interweaving and denser latticework than the astral imprint of a single- Discipline adept’s pattern.</p>\n<h4>Astral Regions</h4>\n<p>The corruption of astral space can handicap magicians and astral travelers. Magicians who cast raw magic in corrupted regions of astral space risk injury or even death, fates that also threaten astral travelers and beings who move through such areas.</p>\n<p>The sight of corrupted areas proves unsettling. Looking at these Horror-tainted regions is like gazing into madness. The astral landscape appears physically warped, stretched and smeared as if reality were no more than a delicate painting that a Horror could transform with the wipe of a bloody hand. </p>\n<p>In game terms, astral regions fall into four classifications: Safe, Open, Tainted, and Corrupt.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Safe </em></strong>regions are areas of astral space untouched by Horrors. Typically only areas in unbreached kaers are considered Safe. Astral beings who pass through Safe areas suffer no ill effects. Additionally, Horrors tend to avoid Safe regions; a phenomenon that suggests the powers of Horrors may be weaker in these areas.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Open </em></strong>regions correspond to areas in the physical world where Horrors simply passed through or performed only minor magic. The scant attention the Horrors paid to the area or the small amount of torment they caused only slightly warped the astral landscape in these regions. Typically, the astral landscape of an open region appears creased and wrinkled, like a sketch crumpled and mostly smoothed out. Most of astral space is comprised of open regions.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Tainted </em></strong>regions correspond to places where the Horrors caused great suffering and torment. Large clouds of polluted astral energy drift through these regions, and the landscape is twisted and warped almost beyond recognition.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Corrupt </em></strong>regions are the most dangerous regions of astral space. These areas correspond to the places where Horrors committed terrible atrocities, possibly scarring the astral landscape forever. Dark and violent emotions emanate from these areas in overwhelming surges.</p>\n<h4>Effects of Astral Corruption on Astral Sensing</h4>\n<p>Astral corruption obscures astral sensing. When a character uses any form of Astral Sensing (as described below), the Difficulty Number is modified based on the level of astral corruption present, as shown on the Astral Sensing Table.</p>"},"_id":"ALnMrBFvPXAzF9l7","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747834235,"modifiedTime":1671747853606,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"iczS86SqzTx8GDmp","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Most spell matrices can only hold one spell.</p>\n<h4>Spell Matrix Types</h4>\n<p>There are four types of spell matrices available to magicians: Standard Matrix, Enhanced Matrix, Armored Matrix, and Shared Matrix. Unless specifically noted, references to a “spell matrix” in these rules refer to any of these matrix  types.</p>\n<p>The Standard Matrix is the most basic matrix used by magicians. An Enhanced Matrix can hold one of a spell’s required threads in addition to the spell pattern. When a magician attunes a spell to an Enhanced Matrix, the magician also weaves one of the spell’s threads into the matrix. This thread remains woven in the spell’s pattern and reduces the number of threads required to cast the spell by one. An Armored Matrix holds the spell and one of the spell’s threads, just like an Enhanced Matrix.  It also has its own mystic armor, allowing it to better withstand attacks that can damage a matrix. The Shared Matrix does not hold a thread the way an Enhanced or Armored Matrix does, but it can hold more than one spell at the same time. The total Spell Circles in a Shared Matrix cannot exceed the Shared Matrix Rank.</p>\n<p>The Spell Matrix Table summarizes important game information for the different types of spell matrices. For more information on each of the different matrix types, see their entries in the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.Using Talents]{Talents} chapter and the Earthdawn Companion.</p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align:center\">Spell Matrix Table</h5>\n<table style=\"width:99.7208%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"background-color:#95a5a6\">\n<td style=\"width:38.9685%\">\n<p>Matrix Type</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:25.9312%\">\n<p>Death Rating</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:34.2407%\">\n<p>Holds-Threads?</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:38.9685%\">Standard</td>\n<td style=\"width:25.9312%\">10</td>\n<td style=\"width:34.2407%\">No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:38.9685%\">Enhanced</td>\n<td style=\"width:25.9312%\">15</td>\n<td style=\"width:34.2407%\">Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:38.9685%\">Armored</td>\n<td style=\"width:25.9312%\">25</td>\n<td style=\"width:34.2407%\">Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:38.9685%\">Shared</td>\n<td style=\"width:25.9312%\">20</td>\n<td style=\"width:34.2407%\">No</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>Attuning and Reattuning Matrices</h4>\n<p>A magician uses his Thread Weaving talent to attune a spell to a matrix. Once attuned, a spell remains in the matrix until either: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The owning spellcaster dies</li>\n<li>The owner reattunes the matrix to hold another spell</li>\n<li>A magical process (for example, a spell effect) dislodges the spell from its matrix.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Placing a spell in a matrix is a simple matter for trained magicians, but it takes time. All magicians learn simple meditative exercises that allow them to place spells in their matrices. The exercise takes roughly 10 minutes, allowing the magician to attune any or all of their matrices.</p>\n<p>If the meditation is interrupted, the spells being attuned are not placed in the matrix. There is no effect other than wasted time. </p>\n<h4>Reattuning on the Fly</h4>\n<p>Sometimes a magician discovers he does not have a necessary spell in one of his matrices, and can’t afford 10 minutes of peaceful meditation. In this case, the magician can hurry the process by reattuning on the fly.</p>\n<p>The magician declares which spell matrix he is trying to attune, takes 1 Strain, and makes a Thread Weaving test against the Reattuning Difficulty of the spell he wants to put into a matrix. This process takes one round. If successful, the new spell replaces the old. If the test fails, the new spell is not placed in the matrix, though the magician may continue trying.</p>\n<p>Working with spell matrices is a delicate business and requires concentration. Once a magician begins to reattune matrices on the fly, he should not take any other actions until successful. If the magician fails a @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.Casting Spells]{Concentration}test, or if the magician takes an action other than reattuning, the new spell is not placed in the matrix, and all of his currently attuned spells are dislodged from their matrices. The magician can still cast spells using other methods (raw magic or grimoire casting), but matrix casting is unavailable until the matrices are reattuned using the 10 minute meditative exercise.</p>\n<p>Magicians can attempt to reattune more than one spell at the same time. To do this, the magician adds up the Reattuning Difficulty of all the spells he is trying to reattune to get the final Difficulty Number.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Maloren, the dwarf Elementalist, needs to reattune two of his spell matrices in the same round. The two spells he is trying to reattune are Flameweapon and Shield Willow. Flameweapon has a Reattuning Difficulty of 10, and Shield Willow has a Reattuning Difficulty of 11. Maloren’s player needs to roll a 21 in his Thread Weaving test to successfully reattune both spells.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Damaging a Spell Matrix</h4>\n<p>Some talents and spells allow an opponent to damage spell matrices. Magicians must keep track of damage to their spell matrices, just as they keep track of damage to themselves. As long as the Current Damage of the matrix is less than its Death Rating, the matrix functions normally. When the Current Damage equals or exceeds the Death Rating, the matrix stops working and any spell stored in it is lost.</p>\n<p>To restore a damaged matrix, the magician spends a Recovery test, then makes a Willpower test. The result is subtracted from the current Damage Points of the matrix. Once the Damage Points are lower than the Death Rating of the matrix, it functions again, but needs to be re-attuned.</p>\n<h4>Spell Matrices and Multi Discipline Magicians</h4>\n<p>In Earthdawn, magicians may learn other magician Disciplines. A character learning multiple spellcasting Disciplines does not learn the free spell matrix talents available to the other Discipline, as they duplicate an ability they already have (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.Advancing Disciplin Circles]{Advancing Disciplin Circles}).</p>\n<p>A magician may learn additional spell matrix talents by using talent option slots, as usual. As with spell matrices from their first Discipline, each spell matrix is its own talent that must be increased separately.</p>\n<h4>Spell Matrix Objects</h4>\n<p>Some magicians in Barsaive still use spell matrix objects—magical items that contain one or more spell matrices. These items allow magicians to have a greater variety of spells ready. Many traditional Wizards continue the practice of wearing robes that contain spell matrices, represented by various colorful and intricately embroidered designs.</p>\n<p>Matrix objects are thread items. The thread Rank woven to the matrix object determines the maximum spell Circle it can hold, just as with spell matrix talents. For example, a matrix object with a Rank 3 thread attached can hold spells of Third Circle or less.</p>\n<p>The magician must be touching or wearing the object to use the matrix within it. If the magician loses physical contact with the object while spellcasting (if it is snatched away or dropped, for example), the spell is disrupted unless the magician chooses to finish casting it using raw magic.</p>\n<p>Like other matrices, the matrices contained in matrix objects may be attacked and damaged in astral space. If a matrix object is “killed” in astral combat, the item’s enchantment is ruined. If a matrix object is physically destroyed, the spell matrices stored within it are lost. Minor physical damage to matrix objects can be repaired, and spell matrices damaged in astral combat can be restored through application of the magician’s Willpower, just as with regular spell matrices.</p>"},"_id":"xSDcNmIcwZKntg3K","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747836602,"modifiedTime":1671747853714,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"jdJyq1dp2Hwilxzw","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Adventuring Groups","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>The world of Earthdawn encourages groups of player characters to work together to solve problems. The player characters may be brought together by an outside force at first, formed into a group for a specific purpose. Once that purpose is accomplished, they may decide to continue traveling together for other reasons.</p>\n<p>Traveling with a group offers many advantages over solo exploring. The most obvious is survival. By working together, the characters have a better chance of living longer, healthier lives. Forming adventuring groups also gives the characters access to a powerful and unique magic; by Naming their group, the characters can use thread magic to improve their abilities, become more powerful, and take on more dangerous challenges (see the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.PwuBzh6bJlasTmd6]{The Workings of Magic} chapter for more information on Naming groups).</p>\n<p>As adventuring groups travel the land, tales of their exploits precede and follow them, told by members of the group and by those who see and hear of the group’s deeds. As the characters seek out new adventures, stories of the group spread throughout the land, and given time the members of the group will take their place among the legends of Earthdawn. But the legends of adventuring groups do not simply filter into the people’s collective unconscious. The characters in the group must build their legend by seeking adventure and keeping a record of their travels, battles, victories, defeats, discoveries, and so on.</p>\n<p>People look to heroes for inspiration, protection, and, most importantly, for the hope that their world shall endure. Fortunately for those characters who seek to become heroes of the people, Earthdawn offers opportunities galore. From battling the remaining Horrors left on this world, to fighting against the Theran Empire, to exploring the land; countless adventures await those courageous enough to face danger in search of glory.</p>\n<p>Characters can add to the legends created by their adventures by keeping a journal of their group’s exploits.</p>\n<h4>Group Journals</h4>\n<p>Group journals serve several purposes. A journal provides a record of the history of the group, its members and events. It also records any discoveries made, and can serve as a source of stories and legends. A journal might provide a rudimentary sketch of an unmapped region, confirm or disprove popularly held beliefs about people or places, or record the fate of a missing person.</p>\n<p>While this type of information may be invaluable to interested parties, journals serve a more important function for the ordinary citizen. The stories in a group’s journal are tales of heroism and tragedy, the types of stories that people need to hear. By sharing their adventures with other people, adventuring groups bring hope to the world and so are hailed as heroes.</p>\n<p>Aside from these loftier reasons to record their tales of heroism, an adventuring log can also earn the characters money and Legend Points.</p>\n<h4>The Great Library of Throal</h4>\n<p>The Great Library of Throal is tasked with recording the history of Barsaive, including the tales of its heroes. One of the ways it does this is by collecting the stories of adventuring groups. Once a year, the Library invites adventuring groups to bring their journals and share their stories with historians. The Kingdom of Throal pays well for these stories, because adventurers’ tales contain the history and describe the present of Barsaive. How much a group receives for the stories in their journal depends on the Legendary Status of the adventuring group. Fledgling adventurers earn a modest sum, while great heroes of legend can earn a king’s ransom.</p>\n<h4>The Players’ Role</h4>\n<p>Though the group’s journal is something the characters create, the players must actually write it. Two considerations should encourage players to physically record their adventures. The first consideration helps both the players and the gamemaster. The adventuring journal provides a record of the group’s adventures, so the players will not have to ask the gamemaster to repeat the events of a particular encounter, adventure, or campaign. The journal also gives the gamemaster a quick reference guide to events in the game, and what information the characters would or would not possess.</p>\n<p>Second, if you want to reap the rewards of money and Legend Points, you need to earn it. Even if the players state at the end of every session, “We’re keeping a journal,” if they don’t write it out, it doesn’t count, and their characters will not earn payment from the Library of Throal or earn Legend Points.</p>\n<p>The players can record their adventures any way they choose. The players may decide to purchase a blank or lined journal, use a three-ring binder and notepaper, or even create a shared blog or website.</p>\n<p>Players should take turns recording the group’s adventures so that no one gets the job every session. The type of information that should be included in the journal are: the names of the members of the group, the name of the group, a sketch of the group’s symbol, and an outline of the events of an adventure. The players can decide how much detail to include in their account.</p>\n<h4>Log Payment</h4>\n<p>When an adventuring group shares its journal with the Great Library of Throal, the payment is based on the group’s Average Total Legend Points. This is determined by adding together the individual characters’ Total Legend Points and dividing it by the number of characters in the group. The Great Library of Throal pays 10 percent of the difference between the group’s current Average Total Legend Points and its previous Average Total Legend Points in silver pieces. For example, if a group last submitted its journal when it had an Average Legend Point Total of 10,000, and has an Average Legend Point Total of 30,000 when they next submit their journal, the difference is 20,000, so the group earns 2,000 silver pieces.</p>\n<h4>Log Legend Points</h4>\n<p>Adventuring groups who share tales of their exploits with the historians and scholars of Throal also earn a Legend Point bonus. Each time a group shares its adventure log with the Great Library of Throal, each member of the group earns a number of Legend Points equal to half of the amount of silver pieces received for the log. In the previous example, each character in the group would receive 1,000 Legend Points. These bonus Legend Points can be used to increase abilities, raise talent and skill ranks, and so on.</p>\n<h4>Group Legendary Status</h4>\n<p>Much like individual characters, adventuring groups can earn Legendary Status. The Group Legendary Status is the same as the Discipline Status Level achieved by the majority of the members of the group. Legendary groups receive the same benefits as legendary characters, but can also suffer the same drawbacks.</p>"},"_id":"XusyT3ZDcnlDOnxe","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747837277,"modifiedTime":1671747854075,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"kEhoCEANoL0NrcZK","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Recovering from Injury","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Characters should expect to suffer harm at some point during their adventures. This section provides information on how characters return to full health after taking damage.</p>\n<h4>Recovering From Damage</h4>\n<p>A character makes a Recovery test to heal damage he has taken. The test result is typically subtracted from his current damage. A character who has not taken any damage does not need to make a Recovery test. The Step for this test is based on the character’s Toughness Step.</p>\n<p>Each character has a limited number of Recovery tests available to him, also determined by his Toughness. Some talents and spells give the character additional Recovery tests, which must be used within a short time (usually one day). Unused Recovery tests cannot be saved from one day to the next.</p>\n<p>Characters may spend Recovery tests as they wish, but must meet the following conditions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upon waking from a full night’s rest, an injured character (with 1 or more Current Damage) must make a Recovery test.</li>\n<li>At least one hour must pass between Recovery tests.</li>\n<li>The character must spend one minute without engaging in physical activity or taking damage. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Characters must also wait at least one hour after engaging in combat before they can make a Recovery test. This time must be spent in a state of relative rest; the character cannot undergo any strenuous physical activity during this time. Apart from certain talents and spells, or the use of healing aids, the only exception to this rule regards unconscious characters.</p>\n<p><img style=\"float:left;margin:7px\" src=\"modules/ed4pgpl/assets/pictures/minotaur-skeleton.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\" /></p>\n<h4>Regaining Consciousness</h4>\n<p>If he has one available, an unconscious character may make a Recovery test one minute after he falls unconscious. Another character can use a Standard action to try and revive him, allowing the unconscious character to make the test immediately. If the unconscious character does not recover enough Damage points to regain consciousness, he must wait another hour before he can make another Recovery test.</p>\n<h4>Wounds</h4>\n<p>Characters suffer no direct ill effects from the number of Damage Points they receive. Damage only affects a character’s ability to function when it results in a Wound. Wounds limit the character’s ability to heal damage. When a character makes a Recovery test, the test result is reduced by the number of Wounds he has. Regardless of modifiers, the minimum damage a character recovers from a Recovery test is 1.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Herekar the Warrior has been through the wringer. He is suffering from 3 </em><em>Wounds and 41 Damage Points. Herekar makes a Recovery test with a result </em><em>of 12. Because of his 3 Wounds, he only recovers 9 Damage Points (12–3 = 9), </em><em>bringing his Current Damage down to 32.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Wound Penalties</h4>\n<p>While not an optional rule, Wound Penalties are best used after the players and gamemaster become familiar with the basic game rules. For each Wound, a character suffers a cumulative –1 penalty to all tests. For example, if a character has 2 Wounds, he suffers a –2 penalty; if he has 4 Wounds, he suffers a –4 penalty. This penalty does not apply to Recovery tests—those are already affected as described above.</p>\n<h4>Healing Wounds</h4>\n<p>Wounds are difficult to heal. A character heals one Wound per day under the following conditions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The character is not suffering from any damage. Even 1 point of Current Damage— including Strain, but not including Blood Magic damage—prevents a Wound from healing.</li>\n<li>The character uses a Recovery test after a full night’s rest. Curses or magical effects that prevent a character from making a Recovery test in the morning will keep Wounds from healing. Wounds can also be healed by some healing aids, spells, or abilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Recovering From Poison Or Disease</h4>\n<p>Recovering from the effects of poison or disease is handled differently from normal damage.

Resolving Attacks","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Because the most common action that a character will take during a combat round is to attack an opponent, the procedure used to resolve attacks is summarized below, followed by a complete explanation of each step:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make an Attack test</li>\n<li>Determine Success</li>\n<li>Make a Damage test</li>\n<li>Adjust Damage for Armor</li>\n<li>Check for Wounds</li>\n<li>Make Knockdown test</li>\n<li>Check for Unconsciousness or Death</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>1. Make An Attack Test</h4>\n<p>Whenever a character attempts to attack a target, whether with a weapon or a spell, he makes a test using the appropriate talent or skill. This type of test is usually referred to as an Attack test. For example, if a Swordmaster is attempting to hit a foe with his sword, he makes a Melee Weapons test. If an Archer is firing an arrow at a foe, he makes a Missile Weapons test. If a Wizard is casting a spell at a target, he makes a Spellcasting test.</p>\n<p>The type of attack determines the test’s Difficulty Number. For physical attacks, such as those involving melee or missile weapons, the Difficulty Number is usually the target’s Physical Defense. For attacks made with spells, the Difficulty Number is usually the target’s Mystic Defense. Some talents, skills and spells use the target’s Social Defense or another Difficulty Number instead. The ability description usually gives the Difficulty Number for using it.</p>\n<p>The Difficulty Number for an Attack test may be modified by the distance to the opponent (for ranged combat attacks), environmental conditions (daylight, darkness, cover, and so on), or other factors (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.pd8hkyC9qgnGIJ94]{Situation Modifier}). Several combat options also modify a character’s Defense Rating (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.JpeeQJzSwc20goxP]{Combat Options}).</p>\n<h4>2. Determine Success</h4>\n<p>The Attack test result is compared to the Difficulty Number. If the test succeeds, the attack hits and the attacker makes a Damage (or Effect) test to determine how effective the attack is. If the test fails, the attack misses. The character resolves any other actions he is taking that round, then finishes his turn.</p>\n<p>Some attacks are good enough to overcome an opponent’s armor or shield, or deal extra damage to a target. Exceptionally well-placed attacks, lucky shots, or attacks that sufficiently focus a character’s magic—these can all result in more effective attacks. If a character achieves more than one success on an attack test against his opponent’s Physical Defense, he gains +2 bonus damage for each extra success.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Silar fires a bolt at an attacking griffin, with test result of 18. The griffin’s Physical Defense is 7, so Silar scores three successes! The two extra successes each add +2 damage, so Silar’s crossbow goes from Step 10 to Step 14 damage. </em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Spells intended to inflict damage on their target may also produce critical hits. If a magician achieves extra successes against his opponent’s Mystic Defense, he gains the bonus noted in the spell description.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Maloren, a dwarf Elementalist, casts the Earth Darts spell at a charging thundra beast. His Spellcasting result of 21 achieves three successes against the thundra’s Mystic Defense of 7. The duration of the armor reducing effect is increased by four rounds, and the damage makes the thundra even more upset— it suffers a Wound as well! Maloren hopes his friends can take it down before it tramples him underfoot.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h4>3. Make a Damage Test</h4>\n<p>After making a successful Attack test, the character makes a Damage test. The dice rolled for this test depend on the weapon used. Unless otherwise noted in its description, all weapons add their Damage Step to the character’s Strength Step to determine the total Damage Step of the attack.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>A battle-axe has a Damage Step of 7, adding +7 to a character’s Strength Step when inflicting damage. Thrak has a Strength Step of 7. When he hits an opponent with his axe, he makes a Step 14 Damage test (7+ 7 = 14) to determine the damage inflicted on his opponent.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Some talents or abilities allow the character to add a Karma die to the damage test. Remember that Bonus Dice apply to all tests the character makes, including Damage tests. When attacking an opponent with a spell, the spell will usually direct the magician to make an Effect test to determine how much damage he inflicts. The magician uses the Effect Step given in the spell’s description, which is usually based on his Willpower, not Strength, and may be modified by talents such as @Compendium[ed4pgpl.talent-description.A7QJTKLK9T9Q9tqZ]{Moc woli}.</p>\n<p>Regardless of whether the attack is made with a weapon or a spell, the Damage test result determines the number of damage points inflicted on the target.</p>\n<h4>4. Adjust Damage for Armor</h4>\n<p>Armor reduces the damage a character suffers, adding to the character’s Physical (and sometimes Mystic) Armor. Generally, Physical Armor protects against sources of physical damage, while Mystic Armor protects against astral or psychic damage. If there is any uncertainty, the gamemaster decides which type applies. Some attacks, for example certain spells or creature powers, are never reduced by armor. This is noted in the spell or power description where applicable. </p>\n<p>The character subtracts the appropriate Armor rating from the result of the Damage test. The modified result is the number of points added to the character’s current damage.</p>\n<h4>5. Check For Wounds</h4>\n<p>If the damage from a single attack equals or exceeds a character’s Wound Threshold, he takes a Wound. Wounds represent major trauma and slow the character’s ability to recover damage (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.mSo8GfCBa5CCXDm9]{Recovering from Injury}). Wounds can also have a negative effect on the character’s tests (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.mSo8GfCBa5CCXDm9]{Wound Penalties}).</p>\n<p>If the damage that causes a Wound renders the character unconscious or dead, the player should still record the Wound. Some talents, spells and magic items have the ability to bring a character back from the brink of death, but any Wounds the character has will penalize such healing.</p>\n<h4>6. Make A Knockdown Test</h4>\n<p>If the damage dealt exceeds a character’s Wound Threshold by five or more, he could be knocked down. The player makes a Strength test against a Difficulty Number equal to the difference between his Wound Threshold and the damage dealt.</p>\n<p>If successful, the character remains standing, otherwise he is knocked down (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.zmPC9yVRwh3qXlXw]{Knocked Down}).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Tomas the Wizard has a Wound Threshold of 8. He is hit with a wicked axe </em><em>stroke for 15 damage, after accounting for his armor. Because the damage inflicted </em><em>is more than 5 points over his Wound Threshold, Tomas not only suffers </em><em>a Wound, but he must make a Knockdown (7) test (15-8 = 7) to keep his feet. Tomas </em><em>doesn’t have any talents that help, so he makes the test using his Strength </em><em>Step, and rolls a 5. The next thing Tomas knows, he is on the ground and in pain.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Other causes of knockdown, such as the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.IOtU3eXuWvSEV7ra]{Attacking to Knock Down} or @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.H9SepRjoJykVMFHR]{Being Dismounted}, may require a character to make a Knockdown test.</p>\n<h4>7. Check for Unconsciousness or Death</h4>\n<p>After a character takes damage from an attack, the player checks the character’s Current Damage to see if he is unconscious or dead.</p>\n<p><strong>Unconsciousness</strong></p>\n<p>A character with Current Damage at least equal to his Unconsciousness Rating, but less than his Death Rating, falls to the ground unconscious. Unconscious characters may take no actions other than making Recovery tests, and are considered both Blindsided and Knocked Down. They can regain their senses by recovering enough Damage Points to reduce their Current Damage below their Unconsciousness Rating (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.mSo8GfCBa5CCXDm9]{Recovering from Injury}).</p>\n<p><strong>Death</strong></p>\n<p>A character whose Current Damage equals or exceeds his Death Rating immediately falls to the ground. Unless the character has a talent such as Life Check, or is quickly tended to by another character with a healing aid, such as a Last Chance Salve, the character is dead. In Earthdawn, character death is usually permanent. Some methods of resurrection exist, but they require powerful and dangerous magic, and attempts are rare. Characters who wish to pursue these methods should be warned that they are very expensive—and the price is rarely just financial.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>"},"_id":"qbYgOkrWgKBvwI4x","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747832981,"modifiedTime":1671747853806,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"mTjlUrKVIDJKEVh6","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Learning Spells","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>A magician must learn new spells from another magician or from a grimoire other than his own. If a magician knows the appropriate Thread Weaving talent, he can learn spells of any Circle, even those higher than his own, though he may not be able to cast  those spells using his spell matrices.</p>\n<p>The magician must be rested and in good health before he makes any Patterncraft tests; a character suffering from any damage or Wounds may not learn new spells.</p>\n<p>A magician uses the Patterncraft talent to learn spells from a grimoire, studying the spell and copying it into his own. The magician makes a Patterncraft test against the spell’s Learning Difficulty. The Learning Difficulty is based on the spell Circle, shown in the Spell Learning Difficulty Table. If the test succeeds, the magician correctly interprets the spell, and writes it into his grimoire.</p>\n<p>Once a magician has successfully placed a spell in his grimoire, he has learned the spell. Though a magician may cast a spell from a grimoire without first learning it (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.NSfo7Hriync1CgcF]{Casting from a Grimoire}), he must write the spell’s symbols and patterns into his own grimoire in order to properly learn the spell. The magical act of manipulating spell symbols on paper (or on wood, metal, or stone) is necessary for the magician to lock the spell in his memory, incorporating the spell’s pattern into his own.</p>\n<p>The magician may only use the Patterncraft talent to learn spells once each day, though he may sacrifice Recovery tests to earn additional tests. For each Recovery test sacrificed he may make an additional Patterncraft test to attempt to learn a spell. </p>\n<p>A magician can more easily learn a spell with the assistance of a teacher who knows the spell. Before attempting to learn the spell, the magician makes a Spellcasting test against the spell’s Learning Difficulty. If successful, he adds his teacher’s Thread Weaving rank to his Patterncraft test. For example, a magician learning an Illusionism spell from a teacher with Illusionism at Rank 4 adds +4 to his Patterncraft test, increasing the likelihood of successfully learning the spell.</p>\n<h4>Spell Learning Cost</h4>\n<p>Some magicians allow others to copy a spell from their grimoires by charging for it. Some magicians’ guilds even sell written copies, or allow their members to copy them as a benefit of membership. The typical price for learning a spell is equal to the spell’s Circle x100 silver pieces. This cost may double, or even triple, if the character is seeking personal tuition to learn a spell.</p>\n<p> Some magicians will seek other forms of payment—typically favors, though ultimately the terms will depend on the gamemaster. </p>\n<p>High Circle spells—Eleventh Circle or greater—cannot normally be purchased this way. These spells are usually powerful ritual spells, and some even possess Names (see the Earthdawn Companion). The gamemaster determines the silver piece cost associated with learning these spells, if they are available to be learned at all.</p>\n<h4>Spell Legend Point Cost</h4>\n<p>In order to complete the process of learning a new spell and incorporate it into  his pattern, a magician must spend Legend Points based on the Spell Circle. The cost of a spell is equivalent to the cost of purchasing a Novice talent at a Rank equal to the Spell Circle. The magician must have sufficient Current Legend Points available to him when he makes his Patterncraft test.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Tomas is attempting to learn a new Fifth Circle spell from a grimoire he found in a ruined kaer.

Untamed Places","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h3>The Badlands</h3>\n<p>The Badlands are one of the most corrupt areas in Barsaive. The area was one of the most fertile lands in Barsaive before the Scourge, and suffered horribly as a result. It is now a barren wasteland with little water, and much of the life that can be found there is tainted and twisted by the influence of the Horrors. Many ruined kaers and citadels can be found, their inhabitants dead—or worse.</p>\n<p>The Badlands have been slowly growing over the decades since the Scourge, threatening the city of Travar and the plains beyond. A group of questors of Jaspree have been trying to halt or reverse the spread, and they sometimes hire groups of experienced adepts to try and find the source of the growing corruption. Thus far their efforts have yielded little success.</p>\n<h4>Death’s Sea</h4>\n<p>Located in southwestern Barsaive, Death’s Sea is an ocean of volcanic rock. Legends claim that the Passions trapped Death itself beneath the surface, and that it will be freed when enough Namegiver blood has been spilled. A cult of assassins known as the Keys of Death is rumored to worship Death as a Passion, and work to secure its release.</p>\n<p>Whatever the truth of the legends, Death’s Sea is inhospitable to Namegivers, and home to a variety of elemental spirits and other creatures that find the intense heat and volcanic rock comfortable. Despite the danger, many seek their fortune by flying magically protected airships over the lava to mine the abundant True Fire that can be found there.</p>\n<h4>Mist Swamps</h4>\n<p>At its mouth, the Serpent River slows and spreads, and as it gets closer to the volcanic heat of Death’s Sea, the air grows humid and filled with steam. The waters become too shallow to handle larger riverboats, and only shallow-draft canoes and sailboats can navigate the delta. Filled with vegetation, and home to dangerous animals and swarms of insects, the Mist Swamps are an uncomfortable and difficult place to visit and explore.</p>\n<p>Despite the danger, there have been many adepts and explorers who have attempted to uncover the secrets of the Mist Swamps. It is rumored to house a ruin that long predates the Theran Empire. Attempts to uncover the truth of these rumors is made more difficult by the presence of the Great Dragon Aban, who claims the area as her territory and does not tolerate intrusion.</p>\n<h4>Parlainth</h4>\n<p>Located in northeastern Barsaive, Parlainth was the Theran provincial capital before the Scourge. To protect it from the Scourge, Theran magicians moved the city to a hidden pocket of astral space, and removed all knowledge of the city from those left behind.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Horrors had infiltrated the city before its departure, and the residents of the city found themselves trapped with the very things they had been trying to escape.</p>\n<p>After the Scourge, the city was returned to Barsaive, its people dead or twisted by the Horrors into a wide variety of undead creatures. Adventurers and treasure hunters travel there and brave the ruins to find magical and mundane treasures the Therans left behind.</p>\n<p>The town of Haven has sprung up in one corner of the city, providing a relatively safe place for adventurers and those who hope to profit off of them. </p>\n<h4>Poison Forest</h4>\n<p>The Poison Forest is a land that is perpetually on the edge of death. The water is tainted, plants are stunted and poisonous, and the animals are sick and appear to be in a state of perpetual decay. Most believe the land is tainted by the ash that blows in from the Wastes, which lie a few miles to the west, but nobody has uncovered the truth of the matter.</p>\n<p>The forest is a source of True Wood, and a few brave and desperate souls eke out a living on the edges of the region. These settlements are frequently plagued with the same gray depression as the nearby city of Jerris, and those who live in the area keep an eye out for signs that whatever taints the Poison Forest does not infect their own lives.</p>\n<h4>Servos Jungle</h4>\n<p>The Servos Jungle is a massive, verdant region in central Barsaive. Home to an incredible variety of plant and animal life, many Namegivers make a living harvesting lumber and other natural resources from the jungle’s edge. The Servos also hides a number of ruins from before the Scourge, and those who venture in search of these places face dangerous creatures, as well as primitive tribes of humans, elves, and t’skrang.</p>\n<h4>The Wastes</h4>\n<p>The Wastes are the source of the clouds of grey ash that blow over the Poison Forest and the area around the city of Jerris. Another fertile area that was devastated by the Scourge, it is currently home to Horrors, their twisted creations, and stunted plant and animal life. A large number of kaers and citadels are hidden in the region, attracting explorers from across Barsaive.</p>\n<p>Many scholars and magicians have studied the ash, and while it clearly has some kind of corrupting influence, they do not know the source, or found any way to fight its taint.</p>"},"_id":"5jjkM6zOHQprHbLV","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747834686,"modifiedTime":1671747854194,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"rRKdMlxBi7GkByXO","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

As he travels, he evokes painful memories in the minds of those he passes through.</p>\n<p><strong>Questors:</strong> Because Raggok personifies ideals that can be found in the hearts of members of every race, this Mad Passion never lacks questors. People who enjoy inflicting mental and physical pain gladly imitate Raggok and accept his gifts in return.</p>\n<p>Questors of Raggok divide themselves into two main groups based on their interpretation of how best to embody their Passion’s ideals. One group believes that ostentatious displays of wealth cause mental pain in others less fortunate and so wallows in all the pleasures of the flesh that money can buy. Their constant search for even more money and treasure provides the resources needed to pay others to glorify Raggok, consciously or unconsciously, through their actions.</p>\n<p>The second group lives ascetic lives. These questors feel compelled to imitate Raggok personally to the best of their abilities, and believe that bringing pain to the world should take precedence over their own comfort. Any wealth they accumulate is used to buy poisons, hire mercenaries to raze villages, and accomplish other acts that cause pain and suffering.</p>"},"_id":"NZHvHf6zAcnOs6uF","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747832507,"modifiedTime":1671747854146,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"rYBOnlrxtYrin0fC","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Summoning","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>This section provides guidelines on how to summon spirits, including information on the forms of summoned spirits and the services they may perform, and a means of controlling spirits called the Contest of Wills. Summoning follows a series of three steps:</p>\n<h4>1. Make Summoning Test</h4>\n<p>The summoner makes a Summoning test using his Summon talent. The Difficulty Number is the spirit’s Mystic Defense. If the summoner wants a spirit to have one or more specific powers, the Difficulty Number for the Summoning test increases by +2 for each power specified by the summoner. For example, if a Nethermancer wants to summon a Strength 4 ally spirit with two specific powers, the Difficulty Number is 13 (9 for the spirit’s Mystic Defense, and +2 for each of the two powers).</p>\n<p>If successful, the spirit arrives in astral space. It remains in astral space near the summoner for the duration of the summoning, which is one hour per success on the Summoning test. The spirit will perform one service for the summoner during this time.</p>\n<h4>2. Negotiate with the Spirit</h4>\n<p>After calling the spirit, the summoner must negotiate with the spirit using the Spirit Talk or Elemental Tongues talent (as appropriate) against the spirit’s Social Defense. For every success scored on the test, the spirit agrees to use one of its powers to perform the desired service.</p>\n<p>The summoner may enhance their negotiation by offering to perform a favor for the spirit. This favor could take any number of forms, and the reason for the task may not be clear.</p>\n<p>Some spirits may require a sacrifice of life energy from the summoner—represented by blood magic damage equal to the spirit’s Strength Rating (which cannot be healed until the summoning ends).</p>\n<p>The gamemaster is encouraged to add role-playing elements to this negotiation. Summoned spirits are not mindless slaves, they are sentient beings with their own desires and motivations—however unusual or alien those motives might be. Giving summoned spirits focused personality traits that relate to the type of spirit they are can bring additional flavor to the game. An earth spirit might reflect the slow, solid nature of its element, while a fire spirit might be more energetic and playful.</p>\n<h4>3. Spirit Service</h4>\n<p>Once an adept has summoned a spirit, he can call on it to perform a service. Spirit services may include anything from helping the summoner perform a task to enhancing the summoner’s abilities. The spirit will perform the requested service using the power or powers the summoner negotiated during the summoning ritual.</p>\n<p>A summoned spirit will only perform a service while the duration of the summoning is in effect. If the summoner does not use the spirit’s service before the duration expires, the service is lost. Spirits normally perform the service demanded by their summoners with little or no resistance. Some spirits may argue or debate the merits of a service, but rarely do they outright refuse. In these cases, summoners may attempt to persuade reluctant spirits to perform services.</p>\n<p>In general, persuading a spirit to do the summoner’s bidding is more difficult than defeating a spirit in a Contest of Wills, but a successful attempt at persuasion is less likely to anger the spirit in question. </p>\n<p>Summoners can use social talents against spirits, but these talents were developed for use against Namegivers, and their effectiveness against spirits is limited. Any test with social talents meant to work on Namegivers (or, for that matter, animals) used to persuade a spirit requires an extra success against the spirit’s Social Defense.</p>"},"_id":"BnYjYC6f19ZnwLh2","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747836350,"modifiedTime":1671747853670,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"rroZDEVnQsAprb1r","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

His exploits build and expand his reputation.  Legends are born through such great deeds; increasing your character’s Legendary Status gives your character an edge in each Earthdawn game you play. This chapter describes how to build your character’s legend in Earthdawn.</p>\n<h3>Earning Legend Points</h3>\n<p>As a character survives encounters and accomplishes goals, he gains experience. As in real life, this experience generally makes him more capable, and allows him to learn new abilities and survive more dangerous encounters. Character experience in Earthdawn is measured using Legend Points. The gamemaster awards Legend Points based on a character’s accomplishments and other factors during an adventure. Accumulated Legend Points allow characters to improve their talents, skills, attributes, and so on.</p>\n<p>Characters earn Legend Points for performing specific types of actions, including:</p>\n<p><strong>Achieving Goals:</strong> If, for example, the group’s goal is to uncover treachery against the Throalic throne, characters in the group earn Legend Points as they expose the traitors. A character also earns Legend Points for achieving goals set during a single game session, because most session goals are stepping stones toward achieving a larger objective.</p>\n<p><strong>Overcoming Obstacles:</strong> In Earthdawn, the characters encounter dangerous situations on a regular basis, facing deadly creatures and other opponents. Overcoming these obstacles earns Legend Points. Defeating an opponent does not necessarily mean killing him—if a group removes an opponent as an obstacle without resorting to violence, characters in the group should earn the same Legend Points as if they had defeated their opponent through combat. Not all problems can be solved at the point of a sword!</p>\n<p><strong>Individual Deeds: </strong>These can be clever ideas or deeds of valor. If a character takes or suggests an extraordinary action which helps achieve the group’s goals, the character may receive Legend Points for that individual deed. </p>\n<p><strong>Roleplaying:</strong> Much as an actor takes on a role, a player may adopt the mannerisms, speaking habits, and attitudes of his character. Roleplaying a character well can earn your character Legend Points, but only if your roleplaying makes the game more enjoyable for others at the table, not just yourself. If a player’s roleplaying disrupts, rather than enhances, the game, his character may not receive Legend Points for roleplaying.</p>\n<h4>Tallying Legend Points</h4>\n<p>Each time the gamemaster awards a character Legend Points they are added to the character’s Current and Total Legend Points tallies. Each time a character spends Legend Points, they are only deducted from his Current Legend Points tally. </p>\n<h4>Current Legend Points</h4>\n<p>As a character earns Legend Points, a running total is kept of how many points he has available to use for improvements. This total is the character’s Current Legend Points. Each time a character spends Legend Points, his Current Legend Points are updated by subtracting the points spent from the total. The updated total after each change in the character’s Legend Point tally is recorded on his Character Record Sheet.</p>\n<h4>Total Legend Points</h4>\n<p>In addition to keeping a Current Legend Points total, which rises and falls as the character earns and spends Legend Points, a player should also keep a grand total of all the Legend Points his character has earned. This is the character’s Total Legend Points, and is recorded separately on his Character Record Sheet. The character never reduces his Total Legend Points; they are mainly used to determine his Legendary Status—how notable his legend is as it develops, and how it affects others as a result (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.xowcOKe8IrgRhuha]{Legendary Status}).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Player Versus Character Experience</h4>\n<p>Players should not confuse “character experience” with “player experience.” Player experience is not measured in game terms; it simply refers to what a player learns about the game by playing it.</p>\n<p>For example, a player may learn how his character should behave in Throal to avoid getting into trouble, or may develop more effective combat tactics against specific monsters. However, his character may not be privy to this information, and during the game the player should avoid having his character take actions based on information the character would not actually know.</p>\n<p>Lessons such as these may benefit a character by allowing him to survive longer or accomplish more, but this playing experience does not directly affect the attributes, talents, skills, or characteristics the character uses in the Earthdawn game.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Tomas Runecarver has returned from his most recent adventure. He earned 1,500 Legend Points for his exploration of an abandoned kaer. Before this trip, Tomas had a total of 400 Current Legend Points and 3,200 Total Legend Points. Adding the 1,500 points he just earned, Tomas now has 1,900 Current Legend Points and 4,700 Total Legend Points.

Barsaive","color":"#0121c1"}},"pages":[{"name":"06. Other Cities and Powers","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>There are many other powers in Barsaive, some of them were allies in the war, some were neutral, and a few were enemies or opportunists.</p>\n<h4>Bartertown</h4>\n<p>A ramshackle and wild place located just outside the entrance to the Kingdom of Throal, Bartertown was founded by those who wanted to avoid dwarf taxes and oversight. During the early days of the war, a fire leveled almost a quarter of the city, and many lives were lost. The damaged buildings were torn down and their materials used to construct new ones. Given the generally patchwork nature of construction in the city, it is hard to tell at this point what parts of Bartertown are the newer ones.</p>\n<p>Despite multiple attempts on his life, Magistrate Clystone still sits at the top of Bartertown’s heap, keeping a semblance of order with the aid of his ‘guardians’—a troop of heavily armed guards and tax collectors. While named to the position by Bartertown’s Council of Merchants, Clystone has held the position through willpower and ruthlessness.</p>\n<h4>Iopos</h4>\n<p>Found in the northwestern corner of Barsaive, Iopos is ruled by Uhl Denairastas, a powerful and ancient human magician. The Denairastas clan have been revealed as an enemy of Throal; they were responsible for the death of King Varulus III, and no doubt have had their hand in even more plots and plans. They have agents in every city, many of them related to Uhl, all of them highly skilled adepts and magicians. The clan patriarch enjoys pitting them against each other, and they often have their own internal struggles to prove themselves worthy heirs.</p>\n<p>The city is a clean, orderly place, but it is not very welcoming to visitors—informants are everywhere, and there is little that happens in the city that does not quickly find its way into Uhl’s information network. With the Therans currently out of the picture, the Denairastas are arguably the greatest threat to the freedom of Barsaive’s people.</p>\n<h4>Jerris</h4>\n<p>Jerris is located on the western edge of Barsaive, between the Poison Forest and the Liaj Jungle. This city is almost continually beset by rains of ash blown in from the Wastes, and as a result the city has a dirty, depressing feel. Even when the sun manages to break through the clouds, it does little to warm the hearts and souls of those who make their living here. Despite the eerie environment, Jerris is a significant merchant power, and home to one of the largest airship construction facilities in Barsaive. The city sent a token force in support of Throal’s attack on Sky Point, but otherwise did their best to remain neutral in the war. Iopos took advantage of a weakened Throal after the war and took control of the city. Byth Vesten is still magistrate, but is now little more than a Denairastas puppet.</p>\n<h4>Kratas</h4>\n<p>The City of Thieves fell to Horrors during the Scourge. The Theran rulers of the city planned to spend the Scourge in either Parlainth or Great Thera, and did little to prepare the city for the Horror’s onslaught. A hastily constructed dome of enchanted earth provided shelter to those left behind, but when the first envoys traveled to Kratas after the Scourge, they found the dome broken and the city abandoned. The ruins became a haven for bandits, rogues, and treasure hunters.</p>\n<p>Kratas is the home of Garlthik One-Eye, a legendary Thief and seemingly immortal ork. Garlthik has been an on-again, off-again ally of Throal, but contributed some assistance to the war effort, as he is well-known to have no love for the Therans. His long career has resulted in a large number of allies and contacts, and he probably has one of the most extensive intelligence networks in Barsaive. Garlthik’s chief rival in Kratas is Vistrosh, an exiled blood elf that leads his own band of thieves, miscreants, and ne’er-do-wells.</p>\n<h4>Travar</h4>\n<p>Located in southern Barsaive, Travar is one of the province’s most ancient and mysterious cities. Its white stone walls and soaring towers provide a beacon of hope to an area that was sorely affected by the Scourge. Travar prospers under the leadership of the Magistrate’s Council, a triumvirate of powerful merchants. Seats on the council are determined in the annual Founding Tournament, and potential magistrates hire teams of adepts to compete on their behalf.</p>\n<p>Travar is Chorrolis’ city, and its people are merchants before anything else. Travar was neutral in the conflict between Thera and Throal, and profited from both sides of the conflict. In the aftermath of the war the city unwillingly finds itself in a more prominent position, with foreign agents infiltrating the city in an attempt to influence the next Founding.</p>\n<h4>Urupa</h4>\n<p>Urupa is a city at the mouth of the Coil River, on the coast of the Aras Sea. Founded after the Scourge by the survivors of several nearby kaers, it serves as a gateway to lands beyond Barsaive, and many of the larger merchant houses from Throal and elsewhere in Barsaive have a presence there to get access to goods from Indrisia, Cathay, and other foreign lands.</p>\n<p>Urupa is one of Barsaive’s fastest growing cities. It is led by a citizen’s council, one from each of the city’s seven districts, supported by a staff of scores of clerks and magistrates. They provided some assistance to Throal in the war, though their location in the southeastern corner of the province kept them from any direct attacks or damage to the city.</p>\n<h4>Vivane and Sky Point</h4>\n<p>Vivane was a Theran stronghold before the war, and the nearby fortress of Sky Point was the base of operations for Theran troops in the area. After the Triumph was captured by Barsaivian forces, the allies turned their attention to Vivane and Sky Point. During the battle, Stormhead, a Horror-created magical storm, was drawn to the city and rained down destruction. After the destruction and the Theran retreat, the Barsaivian Resistance has put themselves in charge of the city, and turned the tables on those Therans who were unable to escape.</p>\n<p>Why the Horror Cloud moved is a source of much speculation; it had been in the same place since it was first discovered in the early days after the Scourge. One theory is that the combined suffering of the city’s slaves and Barsaivian underclass represented a meal too good to pass up. Most serious scholars discount this idea, pointing out that the timing of Stormhead’s move to the city was surprisingly convenient, and it was more likely the result of some deliberate action. Of course, this means somebody on the side of the Barsaivian alliance had the power to affect the Horror Cloud, and the will to use a Horror’s power against the city’s civilian population.</p>\n<h4>Blood Wood</h4>\n<p>While technically not a part of Barsiave, the influence of Blood Wood is keenly felt. The ancient seat of the Elven Court was known as Wyrm Wood before the Scourge. When their wooden kaer failed and the Court was threatened with destruction, the elves performed a massive magical ritual that resulted in thorns piercing their skin, dripping blood and putting them in constant pain. The more powerful Horrors—who prefer to cause pain themselves—left in search of better prey.</p>\n<p>The Wood is ruled by Queen Alachia, who claims sovereignty over all elves. Despite this claim, Blood Wood is strongly isolationist, and rarely allows visitors to enter. Any elves that wish to live in the wood must undergo the ritual and become Blood Elves. The fate of Blood Wood and the Elven Court remains a painful reminder of how deeply the Scourge has affected the world.</p>\n<h4>Cara Fahd</h4>\n<p>Cara Fahd is the reborn ork nation. Lost before the Scourge, it was restored not long after the Theran Empire landed the Triumph. It’s founder and leader, Krathis Gron, is doing her best to unite the different ork tribes and suppress their old rivalries, but is finding the task difficult at best.</p>\n<p>The ork nation was heavily involved in the attacks on Sky Point and Vivane in the war, fielding impressive cavalry forces. While Cara Fahd was allied with the late King Neden against the Therans, Krathis wants to develop the ork nation into an independent power in its own right, and her relationship with the dwarf kingdom has cooled in the wake of Kovar’s ascension.</p>\n<h4>Great Dragons</h4>\n<p>The Great Dragons of Barsaive are not a unified power, but some claim they have been manipulating affairs behind the scenes for centuries. Most discount the idea as conspiratorial nonsense; while the power and influence a dragon can bring to bear is considerable, there is nothing to indicate that the dragons take a serious interest in the brief lives of the ‘lesser races’.</p>\n<p>There were reports of dragons in the area during the assault on Sky Point, but they did not visibly take part on either side. There are rumors that they contributed to the war effort, either with the material support of their extensive hoards, or by sending agents out on covert missions, but nothing is confirmed.</p>\n<p>The Great Dragons in Barsaive most noted to entertain visitors are Mountainshadow, who makes his lair in the Dragon Mountains of southern Barsaive; Icewing, who lairs in the highest peaks of the Throal Mountains; and Vasdenjas, who has contributed several tomes of knowledge to the Great Library. Two other Great Dragons, Usun and Aban, claim the Liaj Jungle and Mist Swamps, respectively, and do not welcome intruders into their domain.</p>\n<h4>T’skrang Aropagoi</h4>\n<p>The Serpent River network is dominated by the t’skrang trade covenants, or aropagoi. House Ishkarat controls the north reach of the river, from its headwaters down to Lake Vors, and they are closely allied with the Denairastas of Iopos. The middle reach of the river from where the Mothingale River flows out of Blood Wood to join the Serpent down to where the Serpent flows out of the foothills of the Throal Mountains is held by House Syrtis, who contributed some assistance during the war, but have been more focused on their conflict with the Ishkarat.</p>\n<p>House V’strimon, one of Throal’s staunchest allies, controls the Coil River, a major tributary of the Serpent that flows from central Barsaive down to the Aras Sea. The support of their warships was key in the attack on the Triumph, the former Theran fortress on the shore of Lake Ban.</p>\n<p>The south reach—from Lake Ban to where the Serpent flows into the Mist Swamps—was dominated by House K’tenshin, who were allies of the Theran Empire. Their fortunes have fallen in the aftermath of the war, and they have been forced to concede some of their territory to House T’kambras, a new foundation that is based in the river systems of the Servos Jungle.</p>"},"_id":"BfM80Z9L6ClaUI13","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747834664,"modifiedTime":1671747854190,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"uXBmyuFOtl6u5VQn","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Moneychangers in most cities will usually pay anywhere from 60 to 80 percent of the value of old coins based on their weight. Legends of cursed gold and silver make most merchants reluctant to take coins not minted by Thera or Throal.</p>\n<p><strong>Denominations</strong></p>\n<p>Throal and Thera use a decimal currency system, with each coin worth ten times that of the previous denomination. Throalic coins are hexagonal, while Theran currency is circular.</p>\n<p>Copper is the most basic monetary unit, and is used by common folk and craftsmen across Barsaive. Copper coins from Throal bear a stylized pick and hammer on both sides, and weigh one third of an ounce. They are commonly called ‘hammers’. Thera does not mint copper coins.</p>\n<p>Silver coins are the most common currency used by merchants and adventurers, and weigh one quarter of an ounce. Throalic silver bears the likeness of Tav Korelsed, one of the Kingdom’s founders, and are typically called ‘tavs’. Theran coins show the profile of a Theran guardsman.</p>\n<p>Gold is usually reserved for wealthy merchants, rich travelers, and governments, and weighs one fifth of an ounce. It is rarely used in trade, usually reserved for transactions in excess of 1,000 silver. Throalic gold coins show the Merchant King Braza overlooking the Throal Mountains, are called ‘merchants’. Theran gold shows the profile of Kearos Navarim, one of the founders of the Theran Empire.</p>\n<p><strong>Gems</strong></p>\n<p>In some cities, gems are occasionally used to limit the volume of coin in large transactions. Unlike coins, which have a standard value, gems can be of virtually any size, quality and value. In most Earthdawn products, gems will be described with their approximate value in silver. Characters can usually exchange recovered gemstones for about 70 to 80 percent of their value in coin, allowing the buyer to make a profit when reselling the stones.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Coins</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to the commonly used metal coins, currency in Barsaive also includes the so-called elemental coins. These coins contain bits of True Elements, or are crafted from orichalcum, a combination of True Elements. These coins are usually reserved for special occasions like finalizing long-term trade agreements, swearing blood oaths, or sealing peace treaties. A single earth or water coin is worth 100 silver, and ten earth or water coins equal one air or fire piece. Ten air or fire coins are worth one orichalcum coin. All elemental coins weigh one tenth of an ounce, <strong>Air Coins</strong> resemble finely crafted crystal. Sharply striking an air coin causes it to ring and levitate few inches. As it descends, the ringing fades. <strong>Earth Coins</strong> are plain brown coins that gleam under bright light. <strong>Fire Coins</strong> resemble discs of slowly twisting flame. These coins are cool to the touch, but when struck they produce sparks hot enough to light a lantern or set tinder ablaze.<strong> Water Coins</strong> are semi-transparent blue-green coins that feel damp to the touch.</p>\n<p><strong>Orichalcum</strong> is a magical metal made up of all elements, usually created through a time consuming alchemical or Elementalist ritual. Coins made of this material are gold in color, but seem to capture and amplify light. These coins remain rare, even among kings and merchant princes. Because of orichalcum’s magical properties, these coins are most frequently used in rituals, or for the sealing of magical oaths and the like. Legends tell of ancient lands that used orichalcum as their primary currency, but most scholars question the basis of these tales.</p>"},"_id":"HOmsnK3lCxG67CYb","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747835035,"modifiedTime":1671747853970,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"vzIudrfuduswVm69","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

This is usually a 2 yard distance between opponents, but some longer weapons allow for greater reach. The two types of close combat are:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Melee attacks: </strong>Made by hitting an opponent with a hand-held melee weapon, such as a broadsword or a battle-axe. Melee attacks are most commonly made using the Melee Weapons talent or skill.</p>\n<p><strong>Unarmed attacks: </strong>Made by an attacker punching, biting, kicking or generally employing his limbs against his opponent. Unarmed attacks are most commonly made using the Unarmed Combat talent or skill.</p>\n<p><strong>Maximum Number Of Attackers</strong></p>\n<p>A maximum of six human-sized opponents can attack a character in close combat. Any time four or more attackers set upon a character at the same time, he is considered @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.RfVAvUWYp3Wn4vk1]{Harried}. The character remains Harried until fewer than four attackers surround him. Note that some small creatures or pack animals can swarm an opponent, allowing more attacks against their opponent than normal. Regardless of the number of combatants, the relative positions of the attackers appears on the Melee Combat Positions diagram.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Entangling Weapons</strong></p>\n<p>Some weapons, such as whips, not only cause damage to those struck, but also wrap around the victim, preventing him from acting. These weapons are noted in their description as entangling weapons (see the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.EFrrXB3rYf9M16cN]{Goods and Services}). If the attacker achieves an extra success on his Attack test with an entangling weapon, he entangles his opponent. The entangled character is considered harried for any actions other than breaking free.</p>\n<p>To free himself, the target must make a successful Strength or Dexterity test against a Difficulty Number indicated in the weapon’s description. If he was holding a one-handed bladed weapon when struck, he may add the weapon’s Damage Step as a bonus to this test (this will help to cut him free, which ruins the entangling weapon).</p>\n<p><strong>Improvised Melee Weapons</strong></p>\n<p>Sometimes a character will want to hit another character with an object not normally used as a melee weapon, such as a chair, tankard, or rock. The gamemaster determines the statistics for this improvised weapon, including any Strength minimum and the item’s Damage Step. Because of the unbalanced nature of the weapon, the character suffers a –2 penalty to his Attack tests when wielding the item.</p>\n<p><strong>Grappling</strong></p>\n<p>A character can attempt to wrestle or grapple an opponent instead of making a normal unarmed attack. When attempting a grappling attack, the character makes an Unarmed Combat test against the target’s Physical Defense. To successfully grapple, he must score an extra success on the test. Grappling attacks do not cause damage, so the attacker does not make a Damage test.</p>\n<p>A grappled character cannot move, and the only action he can take is to try and break free of the attacker’s hold. The grappled target makes an Unarmed Combat or Strength test against the Unarmed Combat Step of the grappling attack. If the test succeeds, the target breaks free.</p>\n<p>At the gamemaster’s discretion a grappled character can take other actions, but must beat the Unarmed Combat Step of the grappling attack to succeed. Silar, the t’skrang Archer, has been grappled by a bandit with a Physical Defense of 8 and an Unarmed Combat Step of 10. Silar attacks the bandit with his tail using his own Unarmed Combat skill. To hit he must succeed against a Difficulty Number of 10.</p>\n<p>Once a character makes a successful grappling attack against an opponent, he can maintain the hold by declaring that he is doing so as his standard action during consecutive rounds. The character may choose to let go of his opponent at any time.</p>"},"_id":"HwETrlXjgRFXX1aQ","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747833426,"modifiedTime":1671747853929,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"wbVpUGn1bFudOEJ7","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Thread Magic","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>One of the unique applications of the workings of magic in Earthdawn is the use of thread magic. Thread magic is the process by which a thread of magical energy is woven to a True Pattern, thereby strengthening and enhancing that pattern. These rules cover weaving threads to magical items, as well as the more complex process of weaving threads to Named people and places. They also address a special use of thread magic: Group Patterns.</p>\n<p>Before delving into the information presented here, players and gamemasters may find it helpful to review @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.LXflR4kKcNa47dlQ]{Magic in our World}.</p>\n<h4>Nature of Threads</h4>\n<p><img style=\"float:left;margin:8px\" src=\"modules/ed4pgpl/assets/pictures/weaving-a-tapestry.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"319\" />Thread magic enables characters to manipulate strands of magical energy. Two types of threads exist: spell threads and pattern threads. Characters create both types using the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.talent-description.ifnChL8TirB09m6U]{Thread Weaving Talent}, and both types are used to add power to a pattern.</p>\n<p>Spell threads are used to power certain spells. Since many spell patterns are too complex to fit in a spell matrix, the magician must complete the spell’s pattern before he can cast it. This is accomplished by weaving spell threads into the pattern of the spell. Spell threads are temporary, and do not last beyond the act of casting the spell. In contrast, pattern threads are permanent, and used to connect the magical patterns of two (or more) people, places or things. The rules presented in this section discuss pattern threads, the type created when weaving threads to magical treasure or pattern items. Spell threads are described in the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.x9iqfUTuPk2ZP5WI]{Spell Magic} chapter.</p>\n<h4>Using Thread Magic</h4>\n<p>To use thread magic, a character must learn Key Knowledges. This usually involved studying the True Pattern (or an associated pattern item) using the Item History talent, along with traditional research to find out specific details. With the Key Knowledge, a character can create a thread connecting his True Pattern to the target True Pattern. This thread carries magical energy between the patterns, increasing a character’s power when interacting with the target, or bolstering the strength of the other True Pattern.</p>\n<p>To use any kind of thread magic, a character must perform the following steps.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Obtain the Key Knowledge.</li>\n<li>Spend Legend Points based on the Thread Rank being woven.</li>\n<li>Make a successful Thread Weaving test.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Threads and Legend Points</h4>\n<p>Weaving permanent threads requires a character to spend Legend Points based on the item and the rank of the thread being woven. The expenditure of Legend Points creates the permanent thread.</p>\n<p>Characters should take the cost required to weave permanent threads into consideration. Legend Points spent to weave threads reduces the number of points available to increase talent and skill ranks. In addition, Legend Points spent on a permanent thread cannot be recovered, even if the thread is unwoven, displaced, or otherwise destroyed. Weaving permanent threads offers significant advantages, but the character must consider that he may spend the Legend Points and ultimately have nothing to show for it.</p>\n<h4>Limits on Threads</h4>\n<p>At any time, a character can have a maximum number of active permanent threads equal to his highest Thread Weaving talent rank. The Thread Weaving talent rank also indicates the maximum rank for his permanent threads.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Tomas knows Thread Weaving at Rank 5. Until he increases his Thread Weaving Rank, Tomas can have a maximum of five active pattern threads, none of which may be higher than Rank 5.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Losing Threads</h4>\n<p>All of a character’s active threads are usually lost when that character dies. Most magical effects that bring a character back to life (like the Life Check talent or Death Cheat blood charm) actually prevent the character from dying, so threads are not usually lost. When a character loses an item to which he has woven a thread, the thread remains until someone else weaves a thread that displaces the character’s thread.</p>"},"_id":"BV0eHCxZBDsj8Yi6","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747834330,"modifiedTime":1671747853627,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"xBUKOLoeOQQOPdUh","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Apply the bonus given on the Legendary Status Table when making Interaction tests of this kind. At the gamemaster’s discretion, another character disguising and acting like the adept in question may be able to gain the same bonus.</p>\n<p>A character’s legend may not always be as heroic as these rules suggest, many adepts have a skeleton in a closet or a dark spot in their history. On certain occasions, this might backfire and put the character into trouble. For example, a known scoundrel is less likely to receive an advance on any payment, because people won’t really trust him. In those cases, the gamemaster may reduce the Reputation bonus or even turn it into a penalty.</p>\n<h4>The Price of Fame</h4>\n<p>Although a high Legendary Status can benefit a character, it often carries a price. People expect heroic characters to act for the common good despite the personal risks. Consciously or unconsciously, they believe that heroes should put their own interests and needs aside and work to help them. Most villages and small towns will ask recognized adepts for help in time of trouble. Communities of this size may even seek them out to solve their problems. Though adepts often do act heroically, sometimes a character needs to act for himself. The conflict between personal interests and the interests of others can pose a dilemma for a character who has achieved a certain level of recognition.</p>"},"_id":"aFX8kD8BJaNYI19m","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747837230,"modifiedTime":1671747854069,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"xowcOKe8IrgRhuha","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Ranged Combat","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h4>Ranged Combat</h4>\n<p>Ranged combat is any type of physical combat that occurs beyond the reach of the combatants. Normally, this is reserved for weapons that project a missile, or are thrown, toward a target more than 2 yards away.</p>\n<p>The two types of ranged combat are:</p>\n<p><strong>Missile attacks:</strong> Made by firing a missile weapon, such as a bow or a sling@Compendium[ed4pgpl.goods.04c1FaFfBlOznsan]{Sling}. Missile attacks are most commonly made using the Missile Weapons talent or skill.</p>\n<p><strong>Thrown attacks:</strong> Made by hurling a throwing weapon, such as a @Compendium[ed4pgpl.goods.6v6YPKGUq8MZGmcW]{Flight Dagger} or a @Compendium[ed4pgpl.goods.aba39puPZF855X2u]{Throwing Axe}. Thrown attacks are most commonly made using the Throwing Weapons talent or skill.</p>\n<p><strong>Weapon Range</strong></p>\n<p>Ranged combat attacks are only effective up to a certain distance; missile and thrown weapons cannot be used to attack a target beyond their maximum range. A character making a ranged combat attack may incur a penalty based on whether his target is at short or long range (see @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.lbyV47kYluGmsNpD]{06.8 Range}. The range statistics for missile and throwing weapons appear in @Compendium[ed4pgpl.playersguide.EFrrXB3rYf9M16cN]{Throwing Weapons}. If an attacker is within the minimum range given for his ranged weapon, he cannot attack with ranged combat.</p>\n<p><strong>Firing Into A Melee</strong></p>\n<p>Characters will sometimes want to make a ranged combat attack against an opponent engaged in close combat. This can result in the attacker inadvertently hitting an ally or a companion instead of the desired target.</p>\n<p>The number of characters or creatures between the attacker and his target is added to the target’s Physical Defense. The attacker makes his ranged Attack test against this modified Physical Defense. If successful, the attack hits the target and inflicts damage as normal.</p>\n<p>If the test fails, the attacker compares the test result to the Physical Defense of each character between himself and the original target, starting with the closest character. If the test succeeds, that character is struck instead of the target.</p>\n<p>The attacker continues on to the next target until he strikes a character, or all possible intervening targets have been tested for a hit.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Silar, a t’skrang Archer, fires his crossbow at what he hopes is an opponent in the mass of bodies and weapons before him. The target has a Physical Defense of 9, but there are four other characters shifting back and forth in the way, increasing the Difficulty Number of the Attack test to 13. Silar makes a Missile Weapons test, with a result of 9; he misses his intended target.</em></p>\n<p><em>The gamemaster compares the test result against the Physical Defense of each of the four intervening characters, starting with the one closest to Silar. The closest character is an enemy character with a Physical Defense of 10, so the bolt does not hit him. The next character is Silar’s companion Ulm, with a Physical Defense of 8. Silar’s bolt strikes Ulm, and the Archer starts readying an apology for his friend.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Entangling Weapons</strong></p>\n<p>Some thrown weapons, like bolas and nets, are entangling weapons. Refer to the section on entangling weapons under Close Combat, for details on entangling attacks and how they work.</p>\n<p><strong>Throwing Objects</strong></p>\n<p>As in life, characters will sometimes want to hurl objects that are not designed to be thrown, such as rocks, flasks of oil, or even furniture.</p>\n<p>The gamemaster must determine the range and Damage step of objects not shown on the Throwing Weapons Table. The character makes his Attack test with a –2 penalty, due to the unbalanced nature of the object being thrown.</p>\n<p>To throw an item at a target, the character makes an Attack test. The Difficulty Number depends on the intent. If throwing the object at another character, he uses the target’s Physical Defense. If throwing an object at a specific target area, the Difficulty Number is 7. If the test succeeds, the character hits the target and makes a Damage test, as normal. If the object misses the target, it (or its parts) may scatter.</p>\n<p><strong>Determining Scatter</strong></p>\n<p><img style=\"float:right\" src=\"modules/ed4pgpl/assets/pictures/scatterDiagram.png\" width=\"351\" height=\"217\" /></p>\n<p>If a character throws an object at a target and misses, the gamemaster rolls a D6 and consults the Scatter Diagram to determine the direction in which the object actually travels. To determine how far away from the target the object lands,  the gamemaster subtracts the Attack test result from the Difficulty Number; the difference becomes a Step used by the gamemaster to make a test, the result of which is the distance in feet that the object scattered from the target.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Brighton, a human Troubadour, throws a flask of oil with a burning rag at an enemy. Brighton rolls a 6 on his Throwing Weapons test against his target’s Physical Defense of 9. The gamemaster rolls a D6 to determine where the flask goes and gets a scatter direction of 5. He makes a Step 3 test (9–6=3) to determine the distance in which the flask scatters from the target, with a result of 5. The flask shatters five feet beyond the target. The flask shatters, spreading flaming oil across the floor, but not otherwise having any effect.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p> </p>"},"_id":"0ME6m9KvOWY4vie5","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747833463,"modifiedTime":1671747853937,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"yQCE68oMx29TuwLC","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Weave Threads into Spell</h4>\n<p>If a spell requires spell threads, the magician weaves them using the appropriate Thread Weaving talent (Elementalism, Illusionism, Nethermancy, or Wizardry). To weave a spell thread, the magician makes a Thread Weaving test against the spell’s Weaving Difficulty. One thread is woven for each success on the test.</p>\n<p>A magician cannot normally weave spell threads and cast a spell during the same round. Having woven the required threads, the magician must cast the spell during the next round. Some high circle talents may allow a magician to weave threads and cast a spell in the same round.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Maloren’s companions are in trouble, and he knows the perfect spell to get them out. The spell requires three spell threads, each with a Weaving Difficulty of 8. Maloren is in a hurry and wants to weave all three spell threads in a single round. To successfully weave all three threads at once, Maloren’s player must make a successful Thread Weaving test against a Difficulty Number of 18 (base 8 + 10 for 2 extra successes = 18). If he rolls a 15 on the test, he still weaves 2 threads, and can try to weave the third next round. Even after weaving all of the required spell threads, Maloren must still wait until the next round to cast the spell.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Additional Threads</strong></p>\n<p>While not an optional rule, it is recommended that players not use this rule until they have become familiar with the basic requirements of weaving threads for a spell. Spells allow a magician to weave additional threads to increase the effect, duration, or other aspects. The maximum  number of additional threads a magician can add to a spell is based on his Circle in the Discipline, as indicated on the Additional Thread Limit Table. The magician must decide whether to weave additional threads, and what they will do before he makes any Thread Weaving tests.</p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align:center\">Additional Thread Limit Table</h5>\n<table style=\"width:93.9896%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"background-color:#95a5a6\">\n<td style=\"width:42.9007%\">Circle</td>\n<td style=\"width:56.3829%\">\n<p>Additional Threads</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:42.9007%\">1-4</td>\n<td style=\"width:56.3829%\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:42.9007%\">5-8</td>\n<td style=\"width:56.3829%\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:42.9007%\">9-12</td>\n<td style=\"width:56.3829%\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:42.9007%\">13-15</td>\n<td style=\"width:56.3829%\">4</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Note that a human who has learned Thread Weaving through Versatility does not have a Circle in that Discipline, and therefore cannot weave additional threads.</p>\n<h4>2. Make Spellcasting Test</h4>\n<p>The Spellcasting talent is used to cast spells. The magician makes a Spellcasting test against the spell’s Casting Difficulty. If the test succeeds, the magician has successfully cast the spell. The Difficulty Number is usually the target’s Mystic Defense, but may sometimes be another value. Most living creatures base their Mystic Defense on their Perception value. Some creatures are more resistant than others to magic and, as a result, have a higher Mystic Defense.</p>\n<p>Dull-witted creatures and most inanimate non-magical objects have a Mystic Defense of 2. Magical items generally have a Mystic Defense based on the potency of the object.</p>\n<h4>3. Check Success</h4>\n<p>If the Spellcasting test result is at least equal to the Difficulty Number, the spell succeeds. If the Spellcasting test is less than the Difficulty Number, the spell fails. If the test result scores additional successes, there may be additional effects based on the spell.</p>\n<h4>4. Determine Spell Effect</h4>\n<p>Each spell’s effect is given in its description. Some spells have a predetermined effect that occurs on a successful Spellcasting test. Other spells have random effects described in a form such as “WIL + 5”. If one of these spells is successfully cast, the magician makes an Effect test. The Effect test of a spell is usually equal to the magician’s Willpower Step plus the bonus given (+5 Steps in the example above). </p>\n<p>Some spells use the target’s Willpower Step instead of the magician’s, or some other random determinant. This is noted in the spell description. Magicians with the @Compendium[ed4pgpl.talent-description.A7QJTKLK9T9Q9tqZ]{Moc woli}, may use it for spell Effect Tests. Spells that cause damage to targets often use their Effect Step as the Damage Step.</p>\n<h4>5. Determine Duration</h4>\n<p>After determining the spell’s effect, the caster determines its duration. Most combat spells last less than a single combat round; once the spell has affected the target, its duration ends. Non-combat spells list the spell duration in rounds, minutes, hours, or some other time period. In the spell descriptions, “Rank” refers to the magician’s Spellcasting Rank.</p>\n<p>If a spell has a variable duration, the magician rolls the Action Dice indicated in the description to determine the spell’s duration.</p>"},"_id":"jufJ6a40Cx9Ilbhx","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747836537,"modifiedTime":1671747853703,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"zzMT9RP7z6nATWnR","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}

Like many other roleplaying games, Earthdawn has an open-ended style of play. That is, the game has no definitive ending, no preset time limit or number of turns of play, and no single goal that marks the end of the game. Unlike other types of games, there is no winner or loser. The object of the game is to have fun while exercising your imagination. When this happens, everybody wins.</p>\n<p>The world of Earthdawn is one of legend. Its people and places are larger than life, the stuff of song and saga. Heroes fight the monsters of this and other worlds; their bold exploits light a beacon of hope for the future, as word of their deeds spreads across the troubled, fearful land. Earthdawn is a world of high adventure, high magic, and terrible danger. Those dangers lurk not only within long-forgotten kaers, but also within the minds of people corrupted by the Horrors. To reclaim the land and heal its heart and soul after the devastation of the Scourge, the world needs heroes. The players of Earthdawn, by creating their characters and playing the game, provide these heroes.</p>\n<p>In contrast to many other roleplaying games, characters in Earthdawn do not simply survive each adventure and become a little smarter or a little richer. Earthdawn adds another dimension to roleplaying; its characters become heroic figures, accomplishing deeds so impressive that generation after generation will honor their memory in song and story. The world of Earthdawn brims over with legends, heart-stirring tales of famous adventurers. Earthdawn player characters can become the figures in those legends. As they build their characters’ legends through play, they create the fireside tales that their descendants will tell about them.</p>\n<p>Gaining this heroic stature through daring deeds is as important a part of playing Earthdawn as any lesser gain in riches or experience.</p>\n<p>For those with experience in roleplaying, some of the following explanations will sound familiar. Those readers might want to skip ahead to Game Concepts or Creating Characters and dive right into the Earthdawn game.</p>\n<p>The opening short story—To the Saddle Born—provides atmosphere and a taste of the language and style of Earthdawn. Specific chapters cover aspects of the game and how to play it in detail.</p>\n<p>For those who are new to roleplaying, the following section introduces the con- cept. This introduction will not answer all your questions, because most roleplaying is more easily learned from other players than from reading a book. This brief overview will give you the idea behind roleplaying; to learn more, find others who are familiar with roleplaying games and learn by playing. Together you can explore the world of Earthdawn, and discover the fun of roleplaying in the Age of Legend.</p>"},"_id":"zL5hIli00UkXNP09","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"earthdawn4e","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1671747834836,"modifiedTime":1671747853349,"lastModifiedBy":"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK"},"_id":"zzOnjWcF3ZwoyiS2","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BMV98URg2U1IJwiK":3}}
