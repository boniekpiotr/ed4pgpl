Natural shelters include caves, rock formations, fallen&nbsp;trees, or anything else that can block the wind and/or offer some sort of protection&nbsp;from the elements. For each success on a Wilderness Survival test, the adept finds or&nbsp;builds a shelter providing adequate protection for one person from light rain, wind,&nbsp;or snow.</p>\n<h4>Finding Water</h4>\n<p>Generally, a Namegiver character requires a minimum of one quart of water each day to remain healthy. Unfortunately, not all the water found in the wilderness is safe&nbsp;to drink. Precautions should always be taken before drinking from any untested water&nbsp;source. In areas without obvious sources of water, alternative water sources must be&nbsp;found.

Barsaive covers&nbsp;a large area, and the Scourge altered Barsaive&rsquo;s geography&nbsp;by destroying many towns and cities, forcing&nbsp;others to relocate and altering landmarks and geographic&nbsp;features.</p>\n<p>In the time since the Scourge, no one has undertaken an expedition solely to map&nbsp;Barsaive, and so no reliable maps of post-Scourge Barsaive exist. Most current maps&nbsp;only indicate major landmarks such as larger rivers and mountain ranges, Death&rsquo;s&nbsp;Sea, major cities like Iopos, Travar, Jerris, and Kratas, and the Kingdom of Throal.&nbsp;Some more expensive maps show the main trade routes across the province, but most&nbsp;of these are commissioned by traders and are not for sale.</p>\n<p>Most mapmakers in Barsaive draw their maps to be used with a device called&nbsp;Shantaya&rsquo;s sextant. Shantaya was an elven Troubadour who traveled across the province&nbsp;and mapped it in the years before the Scourge. As a way to standardize her work,&nbsp;she developed a device to chart distance and bearings using the maps she drew. By&nbsp;aligning the sextant with certain landmarks on the map, a traveler can determine the&nbsp;bearing and distance to various places in Barsaive.</p>\n<p>Mapmaking is a Craftsman skill. Characters can create maps in two ways&mdash;by copying an existing map or drawing an original map. To draw an original map, a character must have traveled over the area he is mapping. To draw an original map, the character makes a Mapmaking (7) test. This must be accompanied by successful Navigation Tests (Talent or Skill) to keep track of position, unless the map is for a very small area.</p>\n<p>To copy an existing map, the character makes a Mapmaking (5) test. The Success&nbsp;Level of the test determines the quality of the map produced. A single success yields a&nbsp;functional map with a few basic details and landmarks; two or three successes yields&nbsp;a map that characters can use with Shantaya&rsquo;s sextant; four or more successes yields&nbsp;a highly accurate map that gives a +1 bonus to any Navigation Test made using it.</p>\n<p><em>This skill may be used as an Artisan skill.</em></p>","karma":"No","strain":0},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Rl4fVjrrUZTSAJSN":3},"flags":{}}
