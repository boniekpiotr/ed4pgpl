{"name":"Raggok (Mad Passion)","content":"<p>Raggok was known as Rashomon before the Scourge, and his ideals were Leadership, Endurance, Tolerance, and Perseverance. Today, Raggok is arguably the most terrible of the Mad Passions, embodying all that is corrupted in the world. He causes the dead to walk the earth, sows baseless hatreds that erupt between once-loving husbands and wives, and tortures the insane with disembodied voices. People say Raggok has made countless pacts with Horrors, aiding them in their evil endeavors and receiving their assistance in kind.

One group believes that ostentatious displays of wealth cause mental pain in others less fortunate and so wallows in all the pleasures of the flesh that money can buy. Their constant search for even more money and treasure provides the resources needed to pay others to glorify Raggok, consciously or unconsciously, through their actions.</p>\n<p>The second group lives ascetic lives. These questors feel compelled to imitate Raggok personally to the best of their abilities, and believe that bringing pain to the world should take precedence over their own comfort.

One well-known tale involves a widow and widower who wanted to marry. Their children, however, believed them too old for romance and discouraged the courtship. Kept locked in their houses by their children, the couple appealed to Astendar for help. The Passion agreed to aid them if they created a painting together. At first, the couple had no idea how they might do this, for they could not meet or see each other, but driven by their longing to marry, they came up with a plan.</p>\n<p>The couple hired a Thief adept they knew to carry a canvas back and forth between their houses. Every night for weeks, one of them would add to the painting, and the thief would carry it to the other house just before dawn. As the painting neared completion, the lovers found themselves waiting more and more anxiously every night to see the other’s handiwork. Slowly but surely, Astendar’s painting turned friendship and gentle affection into excitement, anticipation, and deepening love.</p>\n<p>When the couple finished the picture, they were astounded by the beauty of their work.

The epic poem “The War of Tears,” recounts two camps of opposing warriors, both fearful of taking the battlefield the next day.
